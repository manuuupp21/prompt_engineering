this was probably my first preorder i felt that if the game turned out to be the worst game i played or didnt even run 10 dollars i paid for the witcher 2 and the witcher 3 felt so much like stealing that the extra 60 would still not cover the amount i would pay for the enjoyment i got from themafter putting 160 hours on cyberpunk 2077 i can say that it fully deserves the full price i paid for it on its own merits and after so many disappointments in the recent aaa releases that i had this is the highest praise that i can give to this game ill start by saying that i love urban spaces i love finding alleyways that i have never seen before in my real life neighbourhood i love seeing all those lit up windows at night and i love that there are so many details and slices of life in every corner in city city to is the greatest work the humanity can achieve due to its intricacy its organic nature and how it reflects the human condition since the liberty city of gta iv most games have been disappointment in this regard for example skyrims cities consisted of 20 npcs and copy pasted guards santos of gta v was just sanitary and small theme park that just could not function as city if it was translated into real life and san francisco of watch_dogs 2 was utterly devoid of character and charm previous game of cd projekt red the witcher 3 came close to what i expect from digital urban space novigrad and to some extent toussaint were brimming with life and had all the details that real urban space might have but failed in sizethe real protagonist of the marketing campaign for this game was the city itself especially in night city wire episodes v and his or her story was in the background and rightly so because this game even with its minor issues been the greatest city that ever been built in game every district even every alleyway so many details that i was amazed that my gtx 1070 could even run it at stable fps rate too by the way there is never seen before verticality in night city when gta iv came out i was impressed how many buildings there were that you could enter but most of them were just copy paste jobs with real character to them in 12 years that passed since its release i had expected that this would be polished and taken further but this did not happen until now night city on the other hand does not only offer tons of welldesigned buildings that you can enter but completely opens up new appreciation for the city once you get the leg cyberware that allows you to double or power jump you probably should get one of those early you can probably spend hours parkouring around buildings while focusing on every little detail that been lovingly crafted and placed even some streets have multiple levels and while this is common occurrence in real cities i never noticed their absence in digital urban spaces until i visited night city not only verticality distinguishes night city from others at 160 hours i know that there are probably hundreds of alleyways and tens of shopsbarsbuildings that i never visited and even though i have completed the game at this point i look forward to going back to the game and dissect every little detail in those and the small stories they tell especially whoever designed the graffiti around the city deserves raise as i often found myself looking at those admiringly wishing that the city i live in had some of thosegameplay wise i was not expecting much just witcher in 2077 and this would have satisfied but the game we got is beautiful lovechild of the witcher and deus ex every minor quest offers multiple paths you can take if you have the necessary skill level on body or technical ability and i had fun exploring every one of them that i could have found but i can not deny that this level of freedom sometimes makes the game too easy and if you can not go through some path you can always find alternatives that allows you to skip most of the level and reach the objective quicklygames difficulty level i played on hard is not helped by the fact that there are so many perks you can obtain to transform yourself into demigod that one shots the opponent most of the time i was doing 400k damage with my sniper rifle at the end of the game but enemies can often one shot you as well if you are playing on hard or very hard if you are an experienced player i absolutely recommend picking one of those two difficulty levels there is good amount of weapon variety and unique reload and equip animations and they make you feel like the most badass merc in the city you can also use different hacks to keep your hands relatively clean but i wont spoil this part as i loved seeing how those most of those hacks worked for the first timestory and the characters are amazing i did not think that i would enjoy this game as much as i did enjoy the witcher games as i am annoyed by the rampant individualism of the modern world and most of the themes of the cyberpunk genre hit too close to home but they found good balance between the dissolving sense of community and aforementioned rampant individualism i did not expect that the so many of the character side quests would dabble on the same issue that been driving mad and this theme was executed perfectly without stepping on too many tropes of the modern storywriting for these side quests i feel that the only thing is missing is proper closure or change that impact the world but it is also possible to consider this as deliberate choice as v is just passing merc and not the main character one of the most groundbreaking parts of cyberpunk 2077 is that usually you feel like companion in other peoples main quests and this is extremely refreshing to see game where the world does not revolve around player character i feel like this should have been fleshed out more with stalker like system where every gangcommunity its explicit objectives and the player can see and impact this dynamic struggle for power or survival but maybe this is expecting too much from game that already achieves so muchthe main story is more related to traditional cyberpunk genre themes especially transhumanism libertarian erosion of the state or in better terms absolute corporate dictatorship and artificial intelligence but how they are presented elevates cyberpunk 2077 from another example of the genre to unique experience compared to newer deus ex games where these themes are so on the nose that these issues become mundane everyday thing cyberpunk 2077 with the inclusion of johnny silverhand approaches these themes with so much clarity and simplicity that you never feel the necessity to take breather to adjust your suspension of disbelief you may feel like the main story should have been longer and i thought of the same from time to time but at least there is cohesive story that will force an expulsion of feelings catharsis at numerous points of the story first person point of view and plethora of facial expressions that the characters employ greatly contributes to this as v been much more of relatable character than the most due to povanother innovation that i believe will pass under the radar is how i never felt the obligation to be mr goody two shoes during the game and could usually transfer my personal beliefs and judgement into the story without being punished by it which is so rare in most games you will often be punished by locking you out of content or forcing you to get worse ending if you are not some form of stoic angel but cyberpunk 2077 does not have this problemplease see

oh well admittedly its difficult for to write this review let start by saying that i was and kind of still am pretty biased regarding cdpr and their games and thats why its painful to admit and accept the fact that in its current state cp 2077 is very dissapointing by cdpr standards and in general as wellim huge fantasy and rpg fan and with the witcher trilogy cdpr created one of my favorite gaming franchises i loved all 3 witcher games thronebreaker played gwent on gog for dozens of hours and all of them are entertaining quality content rich titles so my personal experiences with their previous products the countless hours i invested in them and the enjoyment i got out of them pretty much made cdpr my favorite developer studio and they even topped it with their attitude towards their community and the continous support they provide to their games patches and fixes years after release free dlcs paid expansions with incredible amount of contentas lot of other gamers i highly anticipated cp 2077 i had pretty solid idea what to expect i was familiar with previous cdpr titles and i knew it will be heavily text and dialogue based rpg and did not expect fastpaced futuristic fps gta or whatever so im not one of those who compare it to gta v screen by screen neither i complain about the amount of dialogues or the slowburning storyfurthermore i consciously didnt sit on the hypetrain like lot of dumbasses i didnt expect this game to be some kind of miracle that would bring groundbreaking neverbeforeseen innovations in its every aspect and would revolutionize the gaming industry forever i remembered the buggy state in which the witcher 3 was released so i expected to encounter bugs as well my point is that i had pretty high but not unrealistic hopes and expectations for cyberpunk 2077i knew it wouldnt be able to live to the unbelievable hype that was generated around it but cdpr can only be partly blamed for that the unrealistic hype was mostly generated by gaming portals and journalists i do not wish to go into detail about the state of todays gaming journalism and the quality it represents because its ridiculous and pathetic beyond measure and the highly toxic gaming community itself id love to address this as well and share my opinion but i could rant on and on about this for hours but lets just say that its just sad that in 2020 its common that developers receive deaththreaths over the delay of videogame by some basementdweller pathetic nerd get life dudeso lets talk about the gameso far i have played for around 60 hours and i still havent finished the story but i usually take my time in rpgs and complete every sidequest explore everything that i can etc so thats normal i guess its true that you can rush through the story under 1520 hours but who in their right minds would do that in any rpg initially i didnt encounter that many bugs only few barely noticable graphical glitches but nothing gamebreaking the game only crashed once over the span of 60 hours and i had pretty stable performance and smooth experience with my rtx 2080 but bugs became more frequent and severe as i played more besides the mentioned graphical glitches ive seen wierd animations missing textures cars disappearing and popping out of nowhere cars falling from the sky quests that can not be finished unlootable items and so onthe hotfixes didnt bring that much improvement at least regarding those bugs that i experienced but based on the state the witcher 3 was released and the one it is in now im sure all of these will be resolved with the upcoming patches in the next monthsthe graphics are pretty solid with max settings the city looks great the characters sometimes are less so but its appealing to look at its nothing jawdropping and thats totally fine by its very sad when someone thinks that good graphics good game i definitely love the atmosphere of the game the hightech lowlife futuristic cyberpunk setting is great you can feel the strong bladerunner influence and the great music and soundtrack complements the atmosphere very wellmoving on to the story as i said i havent finished it yet so i cant form an opinion about it in its entirety buts its kind of letdown so far its not the worst i wouldnt even say its bad sadly its just not that interesting to make want to get to the end of it and it doesnt help that that the first 1015 main quests and the story they cover have been spoiled by the trailers before release some of the sidequests are more interesting than the main story but the other gigs and jobs become just dull and repetitive quicklymy main problem is that cyberpunk 2077 lacks lot of mechanics that in my opinion would be must in such worldsetting character customization is not that bad as some say there are plenty of options but i have to agree that i have seen far more detailed customization possibilites in other games ok you can choose the color of your teeth the size and shape of your but whats the purpose you cant even see your character outside of the inventory screen not even during sex sequencesin world where body modification is not just possible but pretty much common thing with cyberware implants etc and where looks in general are above all else the fact that you cant alter your appearance later on during the game is just pathetic you cant even get haircut which is pretty much inexcusable nowadays especially that even the witcher 3 offered such possibilitessince cyberpunk 2077 is an rpg your clothes and equipment obv provide stat boosts if you want to use items that provide better stats you constantly have to change them and because of that most of the time your appearance is ridiculous and you look like homeless who dresses from lost and found bin why isnt there an option to change the looks of your clothes while keeping the new stats lot of other games utilize such functionality transmogrification and even tough this is not fantasy rpg changing the appearance of clothes can be easily explained in scifi setting as well for example with some kind of holographic technology or whateveranother big problem is that sadly there is not much to do in night city there are plenty of sidequests which are fine you have tons of gigs and other sidejobs but these jobs are almost identical apprehend or kill cyberpsycho kill some gang members here and there retrieve some intel from somewhere etc and they become repetitive very quickly and besides this there is nothing there are few collectibles you can buy cars and motorcycles there few races and underground fighting pits or something like that and with that we are at the end of the listonce again id like to mention that i know this is not sandbox action game its an openworld rpg i dont want to play pool or bowling or things like that like some peep mentioned comparing it to gta v but in 2020 i expected more it was emphasized that sex and sexual themes are very important well besides some romance options during sidequests there is 1 female and 1 male prostitue in night city on the same street you can bang them and thats it you cant even go to strip clubs or anything like thatjust to mention the driving i dont think its as bad as some say i didnt really have any problems with the controls or mechanics besides that the first person view is useless d but then again im not really into driving games and driving mechanics are just do not matter to in generali expected solid rpg but at the moment cp2077 feels unfinished rushed buggy and just very average which is nowhere near the usual cdpr quality and sadly i cant recommend it you should wait at least 1 year or half and check back then,No recomendado,0,7638,2,Negativo,[],"['Bugs y glitches frecuentes', 'Mecánicas faltantes',

i know many will handwave away any criticisms of this game as salt or reply with git gud but as fan of fromsoft games since demons souls this game felt like the most punitive and least satisfying of the games while the setting is undoubtedly beautiful and there is fascinating story and interesting characters the design philosophy of this game is especially punishing to put it mildly this game feels as if the character the moveset of dark souls 3 with the additions of counter guards and jumping attacks while the enemies have the moveset of bloodborne foes and the tracking of sekiro enemies foes in this game are more punishing than ever with delayed attacks enhanced tracking and better ai while this works it feels like bit too much in some instances it feels like almost every enemy some 2880degree combo spin move giant area of effect explosion or some mix of both in addition to these challenging attacks to deal with enemy attacks are harder to read than ever with many different combos having the same startup or coming out incredibly fast while this may be product of the performance issues of the pc port some enemies feel as if they are fighting with lag switch even if the game is not dropping frames or otherwise functioning normally i have had numerous occasions where torrent your trusty steed will suddenly drop dead seemingly out of nowhere or instances where enemy health bars will strangely refill or moments where i will seemingly be dead angled by attacks hitting headon these factors are compounded by the damage enemies can do it is not uncommon to see some field bosses or more challenging opponents doing 900 damage in an attack which is death sentence for numerous characters especially when these attacks are also fast swinging and usually accompanied by area of effect damage simultaneously the game feels very starved when it comes to runes while numerous rune farming areas have been discovered it is surprisingly disproportionate regarding difficulty and the number of runes enemies drop some of the easiest foes in the game that can easily be stunlocked and killed without difficulty will drop over 1000 runes meanwhile literal giants that can on occasion pose threat drop similar rates of runes it feels bizarre and unrewarding to see genuinely challenging regular foes drop so few runes instead of the commonly farmed areas speaking of being unrewarding while this is probably personal problem i do not feel accomplished from defeating bosses in this game i remember the hype of beating ornstein and smough gehrman pontiff sulyvahn and isshin the sword saint when i power through and defeat challenging boss in elden ring i feel annoyed despite some of these bosses taking all of my skill and ability to beat boss in elden ring i do not feel the same excitement i did in previous games i do not feel like i have accomplished something it just feels frustrating i am not entirely sure what causes this but the game does not feel rewarding still i will continue to play and i will beat it perhaps once that is done i will update my review and give final score however this been the least enjoyable of the fromsoft games i have played for now if you personally enjoy it that is great and more power to you but i have found the game unrewarding annoying and far more draining than any previous games rather than being left with sense of accomplishment after clearing any milestone in the game i remain left with feeling of annoyance as if i have completed tiresome chore rather than an epic boss battle update it is shame i am not playing salt and sanctuary for this review been lucrative salt mineupdate 2 it appears this review gotten quite few responses welcome as mentioned before i will finish this game sunk cost fallacy or not i paid for it and i am far too deep to refund it now as of the writing of this update i am currently level 90 pure strength build i abandoned my original level 60 character after feeling like i had hit wall with twohanded quality build at the moment this character hit bit of wall with commander niall if this information helps with your headcannon about you are welcomeupdate 3final thoughts now that i have become elden lord i still stand by most of what i have said while there are moments of the game i genuinely enjoy bosses such as the fire giant and the godskin duo are pretty emblematic of this games boss design and philosophy tedious frustrating and more of chore than something that can give actual hype while there are genuinely great bosses that can get one hyped up and good early openworld design that allows the player to roam around without being walled off i think many of the bosses feel less like test of skill and more like war of attrition war that you can lose highly quickly however it is war i ultimately won feat that at the time of this being typed 8 of players on steam have achieved i abandoned my first character after over 20 hours of gameplay and managed to beat it at level 110 in little over 34 hours after some experimenting there are good elements of this game the world is beautiful the fashion souls are as great as ever and the customization been taken to the next level at the same time though the boss design is in my opinion some of the worst it ever been simultaneously there are many reused bosses and enemies even for fromsoft andor openworld game this always been the case in fromsoft games but this goes beyond even the dark souls 2 pursuer level of reuse there is good here in the game and moments of hype and excitement however it feels especially punishing for certain builds and playstyles at the same time you dont need to git gud to beat many of these bosses if you ask if you check in on any guide the answer seems to be most of the time you simply need to git bleed or perhaps git spellsupdate 4 seamless coop mod since i first played this game until now elden ring had several significant patches and quite few changes real ones will know the pain of 10 radahn however with the advent of mods especially the seamless coop mod the game is substantially more fun the coop been saving grace of many souls games not necessarily because of how it can make things easier but also the fun community shenanigans that can occur while i still think that on its own this is probably the weakest entry in froms current lineup the waves of patches that came in have made the game decisively better and furthermore the seamless coop mod allowed something genuinely magical to come about the game is substantially more fun and lot more wondrous in my opinion having constant companion to play it with faqqa did you try to adapt to elden ring mechanicsyes i used consumables the mimic tear ashes which is borderline mandatory in some bosses jumping attacks torrent followed the advice of seemingly everyone on the planet and got bleed weapon and i even dipped into faith to take helpful incantation these items can certainly make certain bosses more manageable especially bleeding since we are getting to the point where bosses regularly have over 25000 hp max hp damage feels more and more mandatory to make the game feel more playable will you continue to play the gamei might i am thinking about maybe playing character that focuses more on incantations or sorceries i also desire to help struggling players against bosses i have beaten and be friendly summon that can hopefully make their game less frustrating to be honest this is the only real grinding that i enjoy maidens i rushed through the game from story standpoint not an exploration standpoint so i did sacrifice her to become elden lord,No recomendado,0,7609,4,Negativo,[],"['Punitivo', 'Menos satisfactorio que otros juegos de FromSoft',

i had enormous expectations having put thousand hours into dark souls 3 alone sadly er is tainted by design decisions not fully thought through and refusal to question the ideals of framework first established with demons souls in 2009 and i ended it wishing i hadnt played it at all more on this later or that steam would finally add neutral ratingfor context excluding discarded run and

why i wish i hadnt played it ds3 made laugh cry and stuck in my mind for years and was ultimately about something bigger than itself and powerfully resonated for it er contradicts ds3s critique of wheelspinning by indulging repackaged nostalgia in the same way disneys maligned star wars trilogy left people feeling worse towards the franchise than if new films had been made at allthe story is shockingly conservative with almost identical plot points settings characters and themes to froms back catalogue we again have wellintended rulers cursing the world in an attempt to save it religious fundamentalists spurned vengeful offspring agents of chaos and tarnished now literally player enforcing new world order the biggest change is bloated chain of divine command expanding ds demigods with empyrians fingers the elden beast aliens and cosmic gods but it brings few new ideas this is the reanimated corpse of concluded story that metacommented on such narrative necromancy and is immensely disappointing for it worse what little new exists is often explicit and definitive trading the intriguing mystery of dss nebulous motivations and history that still produce seismic theories decade later for story nearly entirely resolvable in single playthroughthere is tonal shift from quiet tragedy to bellicose grandeur of divine infighting exploding into total warfare but if anything interferes with deep emotional investment its unlikeable middle managers arguing over who deserves the office promotion conflict between irredeemable villains is far cry from the turbulent power of dss greek tragedy particularly in setting largely morally binary and with less charismatic cast standouts like rya or blaidd dont impact like solaires devastating misfortune or siegwards surprising nobility characters were the emotional core of ds but are neutered here by worn tropes and the meandering pacing inherent to open worldsgameplay is also missed opportunity ds3s combat is great but sekiros is easily the best ever in game of its type yet were back to ds3s unbalanced weapon classes and abilities inconsistent magic and same old movesets lacking sekiros thrilling posture and counters mechanics dual wielding ashes of war and guard counters are small improvements rather than an overhaul that had six years to materialise and the camera is as bad as ever content suffers from repetition too dungeons keep cropping with the same music bosses and presentation occupying huge chunk of completionists playthrough and the nondungeon biomes feel interminable as youre incentivised to be extremely thorough in these needlessly enormous areas in search of equipment lore and questsquests are as obtuse as everyones saying borderline impossible to complete without guides from staple magnified by the overwhelmingly gigantic map diluting quality even further ers first areas are exciting but fifty hours in become tedious particularly with the second halfs environments primarily being singlelevel plains with occasional repeated giant assetsthe initially impressive scope grows tiresome in its enormity and leads to game thats harder to balance and populate with unique content particularly evident in the later difficulty spikes and clearly unfinished areas and encounters including final bosses that pale in comparison to the thematic or mechanical significance of ds3s soul of cinder and slave knight gael bosses are just bad across the board most movesets chain four or five attacks together leave you waiting for an opening far longer than actually fighting and many require specific builds to overcome damage sponges homogenising combat into wait wait wait wait single attack wait loop 150 bosses is too many for from to make each interesting fair memorable or downright enjoyableers multiplayer is also froms worst since ds1 hits can sometimes take over ten seconds to register and disconnects prevail reduced summon counts neuters fight clubs invasions are overly unbalanced and spawns are terrible and with covenants gone so too are the emergent player dynamics and roleplayfinally ers presentation is mixed its style is outstanding characters are strikingly creative and full of personality environments are dense with detail and sound effects are as satisfying as ever though the music rarely reaches ds3s heights and is often repeated but froms ambition far outpaced their technical capacity er is graphically antiquated but the elephant in the room is the worst shader compilation stutter in years paired with disappointing framerates considerable crashing and cheating aplenty the stutter singlehandedly ruined the first third of my playthrough dissipating after about 70 hours but never fully resolving and is bad enough to alone make this review thumbs downer wavers between being retread of old ideas and failed attempt at new ones its such missed opportunity if all you want is killing enemies in brutal combat its great the ds

i finished the witcher 3 for the first time this year and because of the interesting story told i got invested and started reading about the lore and some of the books despite this i wasnt as excited for cdprs new project as i wouldve been for something like the witcher 4 dont get wrong i was definitely hyped for this game cause i consider the witcher 3 as one of the best games i ever played and cyberpunk 2077 was being made by the same people 1 week before the game released i started to get hyped for it excited to dive into new world created by cdpr did it live up to the general hype the game had prior to its release if youve been on the internet at any point after this games release you know the answer to itbut since this is steam review i will only be talking about the pc versionto share some details about my first playthrough i chose the street kid lifepath and played as female v with this i come to the probably biggest disappointment the lifepaths were supposed to give you more than just unique dialogue options throughout the game they were supposed to give you unique prologue and change the way people in the world perceive and interact with you to some degree the nomad outsider was supposed to have harder time with befriending residents of night city and the other way around for the street kid in the end it sadly boils down to the unique dialogue options throughout the game and unique opening to the game that lasts total of maybe 15 minutes before all the paths end up at the same 6 month timeskip i real disappointment and wasted opportunity that i can only see getting improved with the planned dlc and not the free updates going from the disappointing lifepath system i wan na take moment to talk about the overall plot in short if someone would ask if the story was worth experiencing i would say yes i havent been this interested into game and its characters since rdr2 in 2018 for this games story is right up there with rdr2 and tlou in terms of writing and engagementthe long version and rough plot summary of the prologue to get you interested you play as v despite whatever lifepath you chose at the start mercenary and resident of night city you and your best pal jackie get job to steal relic from the biggest corporation in night city arasaka successfully pulling of this job will give you lot of eddies and street cred on top of that it is overlooked by one of the biggest fixers in all of night city dexter deshawn so you go and try to steal the relic but something goes horribly wrong you are framed with killing the emperor of arasaka as if that isnt bad enough the relic got damaged and the only way to preserve it and get anything out of this job is to slot it into one of your neuroports jackie dies on the way to dexter from fatal bullet wound and to save his own skin dexter disposes of any evidence of him having anything to do with this in other words shoots you in the head killing you this is rough summary of the prologue and if it interests you i can only recommend playing it for yourself and experiencing it for yourself it is heartbreaking story with endings either being very depressive or hopeful but not true happy ending after talking about the story lets move to the one thing standing in cyberpunks way from immersing you into its incredibly world and story the bugs they are present they are unavoidable and they will throw you out of the immersion but while there are lot of people complaining about them as i am writing this review 23122020 please keep in mind that the witcher 3 experienced similiar issues in its early life i am positive that cdpr will be able to iron out these issues and turn this game into polished product in the near future i alsowant to mention that in my 70h at the time of writing this review i have yet to crash once my game softlocked maybe once and it was resolved with reloading previous save your experience may vary since i have seen couple friends having more or less issues than myself now that i have talked about the bugs i want to talk about my favourite part of this game seperate from its story i want to point out the characters cyberpunk manages to have some of the most alive feeling characters in any game i have ever played matter if it is character that is actively part of the main plot like johnny silverhand or someone that you can completely miss like river ward they managed to make every character feel like they have their own ambitions and reasons for acting the way they are one of my favourite moments in the 70h i spend with this game was talking to convicted murderer that got bailed from death row due to turning into man of god but if agrees gets crucified for an exotic braindance most of these characters get introduced in unexpected ways that make every side quest in the game seem important i am by means someone who completes everything in game but cyberpunk managed to make finish almost every side quest i was able to find and v themselves is contestant for one of the greatest protagonists in recent memory its time to mention night city and its less impactful residents night city itself is incredibly detailed and dense there are small things to see and discover around every corner and visual story telling is strong theme the city feels like its always moving but the residents themselves are keeping this from being one of the most immersive worlds ever crafted they way npcs and cars seem to work is that they only really exist around v which is normal way to save some resources but if you drive fast on long straight road you can see cars in the distance dissapear breaking the immersion it is totally possible to turn night city into ghost town if you enter the city at high speeds this can be fixed with quicksaving and reloading your save general npc ai is barely present with them having 2 modes the first one is walking around the other one is cowering in fear running away defending themselves or calling the authorities throwing you out of the car you just stole from them nothing on top of that the police system is horrible you accidentally run someone over and the ncpd will start spawning behind you while i am of the opinion that this isnt as big of deal as people make it out to be due to the game never requiring you to mess with the police it is still sad that they werent able to provide system akin to gtas to provide fun chases and firefights outside of gigs story or side missions cdpr mentioned something about them seeing this as bug so they might fix the ai they in fact already improved it tiny bit at the time of writing this but i am not entirely convinced this is something they will be able to completely overhaulas the last thing i wan na take brief moment to talk about the rpg mechanics and the soundtrack there are total of 5 skills with sub trees in them there is lot of room for experimentation and you can definitely feel the difference between builds i dont believe you can skill in way to make the game unbeatable focusing on something like body will open up lot of doors for you but something like cool will give you more dialogue options maybe even increasing your rewards for missions making second or third playthrough feel different from the previous ones every playthrough is accompanied by great soundtrack worth mentioning here is never fade away for hitting very hard matter which ending you get i would love to write more about the mechanics and plot of the game but the steam character limiti love this game despite its flaws would recommend to friend and i am excited for the dlcthx for reading this if you did,Recomendado,1,7604,6,Positivo,"['Interesante historia', 'Personajes vivos']","['Desilusión con el sistema de lifepaths', 'Presencia de

in any industry this will always happen as an example like witcher that developed by the same company what they have shown and what they have given was different yet cuts covered only small portion that didnt have big impact on the game and it was success in general people still can defend the game as the best game since ages however for cyberpunk its not so im game developer yet i can able to understand those features cut so late perhaps at the last delay before gone gold since some of them still can be seen ingame and you dont even need to go out of bounds just go to one of the train stations youll get itive seen lots of news prior release such as impressive ai that even claims to have random npcs have daily routine in openworld depending on the daynight cycle backend with unique designs and animations you were able to chat with them ai is not for just civilians they said cops have warrant system that makes people huntpatrol on the player depending on your environmentplace the way of their involvement would even change since the producer said details law enforcement and they mentioned you can even bribe some corrupt officers to avoid this its insane that none of those claims were made into itscrew routines npcs will disappear when out of sight and if they do an action they will do it forever time doesnt have an impact on them they only have 2 to 4 dialogs to speak if you save them from something they rarely understand it they will never try to defend themselves if you shoot nearby all they do is crouching and this happens even if they ride vehicle if you try to steal their car they will simply let you do it and not even bothered by taking it back well if you crash their car by accident even in the slightest way they cease to move because you simply interrupt their defined route they will not see you while driving so expect to get run over by them lotremember what ive said about cops just imagine any game with cops and aim lower because all it does is spawning cops around your vision and all you have to do to ignore them move away since they couldnt drive anything to chase you bribes hunters patrols huge nope this is all you have they will not ask questions or try to arrest you they simply spawn to shoot matter what even in places that one able to see you commit crime one detection but youyou can be hacker with getting into peoples brains the way they have shown was unique but it just turned out they have copied and improved what watch_dogs does its fun yet its just too simple and toned down from promises you can just go into scan and hack from there need for any tools or effort but investing in the intelligence stat they attempt to make it notso overpowered by adding cooldown and magic bar to prevent you to just sit and press buttons if you watch old clipstrailers you can see what beautiful unique and immersive ui and gameplay they used to have yet also been changed into simple one insteadmelee cybernetics toned down as well mantis blades had an upgrade that allows people to crawl on the wall for example also they are not even mentioned in any quests ingame you accidentally run one of those so it appears to be there are cut missions too i kinda get why they have removed the crawl feature because it makes movement way easier on level design like this but why the hell they removed wall running mobility feels okay at its best people even abusing cybernetic called kerenzikov to cancel dodge to another dodge to overcome ityou had more options like using spiderrobot which is still ingame for only one mission and you are only can interact with it to where its going to move it is supposed to have full impact on your build not just classes lifepaths are heavily downgraded as well both in gameplay and quantity they just change how the opening sequence is instead of at least 45 hours as they promised with some dialog options sometimes changing how the missions play but not too muchits an undeniable fact that this is not an rpg they made the game linear and short than any other game they have developed so far in witcher how the game is played and how the story goes on can be changed with your actions your choices were affecting the world you live in but in cyberpunk merely nothing changes cyberpunk some rpg elements that slightly better than other openworld action games but way too far to be onethe funny thing is we comparing it with witcher which is supposed to be less deep experience according to senior level designer their interview basically summarizes witcher series had basic structure that in loop while cyberpunk is meant to have many more layers it is supposed to be not linear they also said level design will have layers but its only can be seen in some quests most places are basic outposts that dont have any verticalityi expected character customization but they made simple creation system instead you cant customize how big is your nose how your lips are shaped where are your eyes placed etc if you have played saints row less budget game you can customize those features look im not even comparing how weak it is against the souls series also you supposed to set how your character behaves whats the childhood idol basically you have the freedom to both create how your character looks and whats his background but all you left with character creation that lacks in everything that even makes you question why were not just playing with an alreadycreated onethey also got scammed us with gangs involving with the storyworld because i hardly remember most of them present i couldnt even count them since its hard to remember something that hardly makes mark on your experience some concepts showed that wildlife and animals are extinct in the universe but mechanical ones replaced them yet this is not can be seen in the game the only wildlife you can see is cats and they are predetermined it makes sense since they cant even code human ai what would be the mess if animals are more involved with the world however it just makes the game suck at immersion the trauma team is supposed to play key role but you can only see them twicethey also mentioned stuff like variety of braindance unseen weather system more romancenudityexplicit content buycustomize properties the list goes on but none of them made completely into game you only can see bds on quests weather is just like the other game and even worse than witchers you only have 4 romance 2 different characters to sleep with 4 joytoys which is hardly making bunch side note keanu reeves made great job despite what others said i liked his performance but sadly the game falls too short once you get used to having different personalities on your brain the credits will be rolledback when its first announced the game will be out whenever its ready but its not even close to it they couldnt even handle optimization and hidbanned the footage from earlyaccess review copies to lazily get away from this mess how they screw up the biggest project they had and if they could manage this game better it would be masterpiece but now its just another openworld game which most people already got bored with they kept some of their promises like the graphics and soundtrack they said that they will add more features at time but the game is beyond saving from their destruction they should have not announced release date or better when they delayed it first they should have delayed it at least around mid2021 and they should have focused on what they have first aimed for this is not the game

now my favorite fromsoft game tldr here phenomenal and rich combat beautiful world packed with secrets dark and twisted story that is never spoon fed to the player the game does have some performance issues it runs just fine but on the borders of loading zones the game will drop frames even with beefy computerphenomenal combat taking elements from demons souls through sekiro the stance system brought in from sekiro is the highlight of the combat the game truly rewards heavy attacks torrent the players steed offers another layer of combat mechanics there are many styles of fighting to master and the game offers the player the opportunity to explore different styles throughout the gamefighting in this game is difficult to access and the player wont make real progress until at least moderate level of mastery is obtained there is boss that serves as filter and the player can not progress through the story related dungeon until they have some level of knowledge however the upside of this is that the skill ceiling is very high i have well over 2000 hours across their catalog of games and i was not able to stop using my shield until nearly halfway through the game i am very stubborn though and if i had tried different methods of play i would have had much more success in many ways elden ring is more difficult than any fromsoft game but also easier than any other because of the numerous options the player hasbeautiful world full of challenging enemies less linear than any fromsoft game prior and done beautifully the player is encouraged to explore and rewarded for it there is also massive plethora of completely optional content that hides incredible levels and bosses level design is fantastic including looping dungeons with many paths of progress tons of clever

lead the player to draw their own conclusions the player is faced with choices that have impact on the story and these are not minor choices or impacts they all contribute to different endings only one of which i have experienced deep and rich factions will present themselves to the player and it really is difficult to know which one is right the story is dark and disgusting at times and many characters are mere hollow husks of the heroes they once were there are scarred battlefields of stalemate wars and these battles are explained through item descriptionsfromsoft rewards skilled

go to second on my list of from titleselden ring currently what many would consider serious performance issues loading zones have been an issue for fromsoft in the past and this game makes those issues quite apparent when on the junction of few loading zone borders the game can drop frames like crazy i have 5700xt and at highultra settings under good conditions at 1440p i get stable 60fps in heavy combat with lots of enemies the framerate is still stable the framerate issues are entirely down to loading zone borders fromsoft is not lazy company and i am confident that the issue will be improved over time but it is present currentlyi rate this game 9510 if it performed correctly all the time i would rate it an 1010 this is my favorite game in my steam libraryediti have now played an additional 240 hours and done some thinkingi think that this game is objectively better than any souls game prior including demons souls with this said elden ring is also perhaps my favorite game ever and my least favorite souls game i realize that these are contradictory allow to explainthis game is phenomenal for all the reasons listed above i feel that as of patch 106 the game is quite well balanced and quite bug free especially for game of this scope if we think of other large scale aaa open world games like skyrim or cyberpunk the state of the game currently is much more finished than either skyrim or cyberpunk especially after only 6 months my overall rating is solid 1010 it is highly refined masterworksince it is masterwork it is not my favorite souls game i lack that absolutely charming and endearing feeling that dks1 gave and demons souls gives the same nostalgic fuzzy feeling dks2 is obviously diamond in the rough and dks3 is even better than des or 1 or 2 but i didnt like it as much just now after struggling with how to phrase this for months i have come up with sentence to summarize some semblance of sentimentsomething about having an incredibly powerful formula and

i know im quite late to the review party and everything under the sun already been both praised and scrutinized on this game however as selfproclaimed cp2077 fanboy that rode the hype train and even built my latest gaming rig to prepare for its launch yes even scoring rtx 3080 in time i feel compelled to write out my thoughts long post ahead i originally wrote more but steam an 8000 character limit bahmy first impressions massive absolutely breathtaking the first time you step foot inside night city its simply marvel to behold sprawling concrete jungle that assaults your senses with neon signs beckoning you to spend and consume the sounds and sights are very atmospheric various districts reflect the people that work and live there for example the corporate sector everyone is mostly dressed to impress from business corpos to the lavishly lifestyled other areas are more worn down grungy swirling with smog and dust gangs transients invalids and generally povertystricken folks are more prominent here industrial sectors spit out flames from their towers autonomous machinery echoing in the distance making you wonder what cybernetic creations are being built the badlands desert area is an interesting contrast to the bustling city life barren wasteland smattered with nomad clans bloodthirsty gangs and rolling sandstorms the denizens of nc are also fairly varied in shape size and cybernetics it really feels like fully functional cyberpunk city high tech and low life the main plot is fairly interesting and the inclusion of keanu reeves as johnny silverhand was nice touch the main characters you interact with are also pretty realistic looking and are animated well the story missions are decent enough however my major gripe is with all of the side content in the way it was presented lot of them involve characters just straight up bombarding you with calls when you get near certain locations you will get spammed lot and its very jarring they became bit of chore between running around waypoints and fast travel stations it was like i was playing skyrim at times rather than cdpr title the missions really needed to be more organic in nature the playstyles in this game are varied enough that it caters to most peoples tastes you can spec into guntoting maniac like and just slaughter enemies mercilessly like the terminator you can become hacking prodigy and fry the eyeballs right out of someones head stealth it up with ninja sword whatever you want its likely there there are also 3 main lifepaths that determine your backstory but they dont affect the games story much if at all you get wide selection of weapons to use ranging from traditional guns and knives to tech weaponry that uses different perks such as autoaim some weapons like turrets can only be used if you have the right perk i would have hoped for few more kinds of weapons but for the most part these do the job well if there ever was huge variety of something in this game it would likely have to be clothing there is an overwhelming selection of wearables to choose from however as is the problem in most rpgs you will often be seeking out the items with the best stats in turn if youre relying on loot which is usually the case this means your character will look like complete freak at times sport coat shiny yellow baggy pants cowboy boots and trilby hat oh boy if you go with your fashion sense instead youll get nice looking character that will practically die when the wind blows as the game progresses youll find enough loot that it will become easier to find the look you want as well as the armor but early game its hot mess they really should have included an option that some rpgs include where you can change the appearance of something you like to the stats of another item basically adopting the look but retaining the stats theres also great selection of cars and bikes to choose from many of which you can buy and own theyre very detailed inside kudos to the art team on this and you can listen to various radio stations that said the music is fairly varied but familiar enough to relate to metal glam rock rap latino techno etc unfortunately you cant own all of the cars in the game and even worse you can not modify them either this was rumored to be one of many planned features that got cut short due to time constraints hopefully it will be available in future dlc one aspect of the game i really need to gush over is the photo mode this is by and far the new gold standard for games that include this mode there are ton of options you can use to tweak photos different filters backgrounds stickers posesi probably spent about half my time ingame with this mode and ive taken 300 screenshots i really hope that other games take note of this robust system and incorporate something similar its an absolute blast performance and stability this is where it gets rather ugly theres hiding it this game is chock full of issues even 4 months after release i know lot of people are still having issues with getting decent fps rates on this game for game thats supposed to run better frames on rtx and dlss i fail to see it im running core i9 10850k 49ghz with 32gb ram rtx 3080 with all settings maxed and yet i still cant hit 60fps at times mostly it likes to run in the 50s but sometimes dips down to the high 30slow 40s i cant even imagine how it runs on lower rigsand the bugsoh man i think the longer i played the game it got worse to the point that it almost prevented from finishing the game near the end most of them werent too bad such as visual glitches but others would get stuck on objects or just get killed instantly from doing something like hopping onto counter despite multiple delays i believe cdpr just didnt have enough time to fix anything the devs were pressured by corporate to push out the product before christmas 2020 and this was the unfortunate end result another gripe i have most of the game is all style substance theres lot to behold with the sights and the details the game oozes atmosphere but theres nothing to enjoy if you want to roleplay within it the more you play the more your heart sinks when you notice the amount of features that dont exist npcs interact with odd responses that dont even qualify as typical generic ones i cant sit on bench or stool and buy noodle bowl or whatnot hundreds of doors that say locked and cant be opened arcade games that cant be played i cant even sleep on my bed properly sleeps sideways off the side of the bed you are given world to play around in but theres sand in the sandbox for something so painstakingly well made in terms of detail it hurts to know that you cant truly be part of it final thoughts ultimately i really enjoyed the game it wasnt quite what i expected from all the hype though the amount of bugs and missing content really cut short the potential it had it could have been so much better and would have benefitted from another delay of at least 6 months to year although i have played games that were much much worse than this ill definitely play this again as i need to finish my 100 achievement run but i will wait until the game is patched up and ideally once all the dlc is released despite the many flaws it had it still was phenomenal experience i enjoyed my stay in the dystopian future that is night city cruel place where nobody wins and there are truly happy endings sometimes thats just how life is and i can appreciate good game that reflects that endless thanks to the talented dev team for their hard work i hope to see more of the cyberpunk 20xx series in the future,Recomendado,1,7587,10,Positivo,"['Detalles visuales y atmósfera inmersiva de Night City', 'Variedad de estilos de juego y personalización',

28 enero cyberpunk 2077 labor of love or broken messi was not victim of the mass hype nor the outright lies that occurred prior to cyberpunk 2077s launch i knew nothing about the game postrelease past the setting and its incredibly buggy nature hell this was my first cd projekt red game i was always interested in at least giving it shot considering it holds the title of one of the biggest pc launches of all time years later following hundreds of bug fixes and after nomination for the labor of love award now seemed like there wouldnt be better time to try it as for what i think of the game if you enjoy bethesdas openworld adventures like elder scrolls or modern fallout games play this game i think youll enjoy it infinitely more so than those games and that sentiment will probably extend to other lowerquality openworld games that have flooded the market cyberpunk may not have been what was promised at launch to this day but i think its still an enjoyable experiencehttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2925222522the biggest elephant in the room for cyberpunks gameplay is that its barely an rpg i have already made comparison to bethesdas openworld rpgs but the one cyberpunk is most similar to to be fallout 4 the roleplaying elements are present but fairly limited when compared to others of the genre especially when you factor in how it was advertised to excel in this way when you hear about how cyberpunk straightup lied with its marketing this is how the effects of your chosen backstory are restricted to few dialogue options and different opening cutscene your choices will matter but not for very long outside of specific character questlines and the main quest the skill trees are flooded with simple stat increases with most of the interesting upgrades being behind the various cybernetic enhancements instead there are tons of options for builds and weapons but the way the game is built encourages you to spec heavily into one weapon type and stick with it i honestly think the skill tree and leveling system could be scrapped entirely and i would find the game more enjoyable the shooting isnt all that refined either as i said earlier you have plenty of options on how to handle combat hacking sneaking going nonlethal or just going in guns blazing are just brief examples of the unique ways you can interact with enemies the problems stem from enemies not being nearly as adaptable back with the player youll fight vehicles drones mechsuits robots and various cybernetically enhanced humans but roughly 90 of combat encounters are composed of just normal people i never had to adapt my playstyle to new threat and my monowire just shredded everything i never thought to experiment with new playstyle or weapon because nothing ever posed enough of threat even though the gameplay is subpar i just could not put it downthe main selling point is actually the massive and immersive open world you have to explore the world of night city feels incredibly realistic and itll take you forever to completely run out of things to do night city is so well put together that i didnt start using fast travel until i hit the 30hour mark i was constantly pulled into the experience and the illusion was almost never shattered and its not like exploration stops at generic future city the outskirts of the map include more suburban neighborhoods and vast desert with mobile camps and raiders if you enjoy exploration you will love cyberpunk the game even rewards you for walking around the world with unique encounters sidequests gear or just the simple ability to admire the scenery i personally recommend choosing to do side jobs more than gigs because theyre the more narrativefocused quests some of my favorite encounters were stumbling into cyberpsychos that were boss fights my favorites of the bunch involved dodging sniper in the open badlands and fighting someone in mechanical skeleton that fired laser beams i dont think anything else other than the story wouldve solidified my opinion on cyberpunk the writing in this game is one of the strongest ive seen in an openworld game from the main plot to the sidequests every piece of the english language found here is delightfully put together the characters were the strongest element for personally characters that were just talking cars and vending machines have more personality than 90 of video game characters johnny silverhand is the clear highlight as the deuteragonist but that is far from saying others never stood chance of competing with him the animations and voice acting do lot to sell these characters too the themes of the plot arent limited to the standard cliche cyberpunk ones as well its not revolutionary for the genre in that sense but i still think its highlight for this subsect of fiction i personally enjoyed that each of the games endings felt like satisfying conclusion to the plot in entirely unique ways its very rare for game to have multiple endings and for one of them to not be the good ending and i adore cyberpunk for that people are going to take away vastly different message from the game depending on what you choose in the final few moments httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2925221345quick note the soundtrack is also really good been good to know new dawn fades and the rebel path are some of my favorites of the standard original bits but theres also large chunk of songs composed by johnnys band that are actually in the game never fade away is likely the most iconic of the bunch but its full album theres bunch of licensed music as well that you can listen to while drivingand theres something i feel that i probably dont have to mention but i feel inclined to while nowhere near as bad as its launch the game is still at bethesda level of quality when it comes to bugs while cyberpunk 2077 never crashed for i did get softlocked and experienced dozens of graphical bugs and technical glitches and for game that focuses so heavily on immersion this will pull you out of the experience every time it happens npcs faces wont load in until youve looked at ps2 model for few seconds my voice actor swapped genders for one scene only to immediately fix itself the next time i opened my mouth vehicles would float in the area on the regular one dialogue section at the very end of the game had character holding gun while using his tablet there were people tposing in the opening cutscene for s sake not only is this the patched version but this is also the pc version god help you if you played on last gen console while its amazing that the game is in playable state now it was unethical for the studio to release cyberpunk in the state that they did cyberpunk isnt labor of love out of passion its out of necessity cd projekt red shouldnt be applauded for doing the bare minimum and fixing broken product httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2925219285cyberpunk 2077 is far from the best rpg out there its probably not even close to the best openworld game but it is one of the most immersive games with very compelling narrative that constantly pulls you in only for the hundredth bug to immediately pull you out while it wouldve made the game less glitchy i dont think any more time in the oven wouldve make it any better there was clear conflict of interest in what gameplay genre the developers wanted to make im personally giving the game 710 i think the people arguing that this game is one of the worst out there are dead wrong but its still far from what was promised and excluding the bugs and disastrous launch im ok with that,Recomendado,1,7583,11,Positivo,"['Inmersión', 'Narrativa', 'Exploración']","['Bugs', 'Limitaciones en elementos RPG']",No

ive been playing this game to death the past few days and im really not sure if im going to go back to it cyberpunk 2077 tries to do lot but fails to do anything particularly well so im going to just breakdown different aspects and features of the game driving vehicles ill start off with mostly positive here i think the driving is pretty good i just think the main issue is the other cars on the road any time you crash into car theres good chance youll get stuck in it cars randomly swerve in front of you people seem to do this as well and the ai is nonexistent the game is best played with motorcycle as you can drive straight through traffic and it feels really nice there is absolutely reason to use anything other than motorcycle in this gamevehicles are not customizable at all and you buy them by tracking the quest in the journal menu which feels like the wrong way to do that it just felt wrong considering it only gave you 1 task which was buy x vehicle this to felt like they needed to use one of their existing systems to let players acquire vehicles and didnt want to put the time into vehicle shop of some kind which is disappointing it just doesnt fit in that menu at all stealth the stealth is by far the worst ive ever seen in any game the enemies either have eagle eyes and see you from miles away instantly or they are blind as bat and see absolutely nothing the walking patterns of the enemies look extremely random sometimes and the cameras are extremely annoying as to hack anything you need to look at it in direct sight which puts you in danger of being caughtnot to mention that when an enemy does find you they instantly alert every other enemy on the map and know exactly where you are it wouldve been way more fun if you had few seconds to fix your mistake forcing you into danger and out in the open to kill the enemy combat the combat is ok at best its nothing special enemies have such janky animations and move so randomly that youll miss 90 of your headshots with the sniper rifle and 98 of the game is shooting the same human models with different clothes and mostly the same weapons the robots rarely show up at all and act as bigger version of humans that sponge bullets rather than having unique features this is what i wanted from humans more unique abilities you have world of cybernetics and the best you can do is someone who moves towards you really fastgrenades feel useless as most enemies are never grouped together and run from place to place constantly the emp was somewhat useful although there were many times where it didnt do anything at allstorythe story felt like the highlight of the whole game but even that collapsed at the end spoilers here but i honestly felt like it was rushed at the end i did not see it coming it feels like youre at the peak and then theres one last quest and it ends quite abruptly i did 3 different endings and each time the credits rolled i did not expect it it just felt emptythe first 4 hours of the story are honestly magicalweapons items clothingim not sure how i want to critique the food items but i did not use them for the entirety of the story they just feel so hard to find and useless at the same time i have so much and thats real shame considering how much of it is all over the placea huge majority of the weapons are exactly the same it started to feel pointless to even loot enemies for weapons as i knew they would just be pretty much the same weapon there was little to variety for most of the gameas for cybernetics there really arent that many and their abilities are quite boring you get the real good ones like the double jump which as you can expect is very glitchy and hardly works then the rest are just stat increases that just arent funthe health items have almost identical icons and names and they really expect you to know the difference and strategically use them people are midcombat chances are they are just going to press x and see what happens clothing is irritating as you either choose looks or stats and go with whatever as nothing really goes together visually since i was prioritizing best stats my character at the end of the game was wearing bright yellow jacket bright blue trousers with red parts in it customizing your look was mentioned quite heavily in the gameplay trailer so the fact that you need to sacrifice serious gameplay advantages to have decent looking character is quite let downgraphicsthis is hard for to judge as there were times where the game looked spectacular and blew my mind then there were times where it looked absolutely terrible i choke the latter up to the character models and visual glitches ruining everything i think that the game could recover from this issue with patches to the gameenemy hideoutsearly in the game the most fun i had was going to all the enemy hideouts and killing them all for quick money and good loot i ended up doing these quite heavily in the middle of the game so after i finished the main story i went back to try the high and very high difficulty ones and was very disappointed first of all the enemies are scaled in difficulty almost entirely by increasing their health and damage to ridiculous proportions to the point where it just feels extremely unfair some of them i was getting instakilled by sniper rifle and you cant even stealth because the enemy breaks out the game is basically just saying you cant do these i feel as though they should have been possible if you played smart but instead they shut off every possible way of winning eg increasing ram amount for hacking to be too high making stealth kills impossible and as i said increasing health and damage to high amountsmovementi cant believe the movement is this hurrendous especially the tailing of characters i dont even know how they messed this up so badly when you follow an npc character as they are talking you will be forced to slow walk which is fine but for reason it randomly lets you sprint again at random points even when you arent pressing anything other than w and in those situations you can just sprint ahead regardlesscrouching is so incredibly slow but is still necessary to the combat so you cant just avoid doing it it breaks the pace of combat when you have to get up and down so slowlysliding is useless i have absolutely idea what purpose it serves its also very slow and you stop sliding after about 3 metres and take 2 seconds to get off the ground again it purpose in the story and combat it provides advantages eitherfunctionalityit to be said this is by far one of the buggiest games i have ever played every single one of the things i have listed so far and even things i havent glitched or bugged at some point in the game some required restarts or going back to checkpoints others were harmless but immersion breaking characters glitching through the map animations not loading cutscenes loading into the npcs camera position and being inside their head your car getting stuck in other cars motorcycles being able to ride up npcs into the air randomly standing on dynamic prop which then sends you flying 30 metres across the floor or into the air quests not loading or the digital biochip effect staying on the screen outside of cutscenes forever until you reload characters talking over each other its an absolute mess of functionality and is by far one of the worst killers of this gameit must be said that i really did enjoy the first 4 hours of this game but it suffers from the mans sky effect where the first few hours are amazing due to discovery and then you discover the reality,No recomendado,0,7578,12,Negativo,['Driving mechanics'],"['Stealth mechanics', 'Combat mechanics', 'Weapon variety', 'Cybernetics abilities', 'Health

new generation of openworld adventure this game is not what cdpr try to advertiseim not gon na complain about bugs glitches and performance issue because they gon na fix it eventually in the futuremy expectation for this game is not that high im expect everything that theyve said what i can or cant do in this game im playing this game on hard difficulty and go with hybrid handgunstealth hack build hard in cdpr games is not hard at all which is understandable because is not what they try to achieve anyway you can play any style that you want and dont have to worry about specific build like i need to make this build or ill having hard with the game which is great you can try any build any play style that you want i dont think you gon na having hard time in this game first off lets talk about good things in this game the graphic is great even tho i dont actually care about graphic in game that much world design is so good its so detail each district unique environment that you can tell the different from each districts that youre in main characters model and animation looks really good how they are moving around and talk to you well wout the bugs and glitches ofc im try not to talk about it btw lol the story and narrative is really good the writing and the dialogues in this game it make immersive in the story it might be even better than the withcer 3 photomode is probably the great additional to this game cause i spend time in photomode more than shooting in this game ok that might be over exaggerated but its kinda true tho the soundtrack is really good you know what the soundtrack the banger i have to recommend these few track its so good the rebel path scavenger hunt мусорщики never fade away samurai cover this one is the best song in the game for johnny silverhand might not be the greatest character in video games but is one of the good thing in this game voice acting is cdpr standard what is that mean its mean the voice acting is greatnow lets talk about what i dislike about this game character creation is really limited the openworld aspect of the game i know this game is not sandbox open world but if you gon na advertise the game about being immersive in openworld adventure game but you couldnt get this right then thats the problem in the trailer said something like looks is everything in night city and there are some of dev interview said something about npcs will comment or react to your looks in night city which it never happen to btw in 2077 we dont have barber shop and tattoo shop really what about cosmetic cyberware nope we dont get that in this game either i think they can add this in to the game later but for now this is the problem for you cant customize your character after the character creation which is pretty to npcs ai doesnt have routine they just walking around mindlessly wow so immersive they dont react differently every npcs will run away or scare when you shoot gun in the air one try to fight back or act different than this it make the world feel hollow car ai i mean you can find lots of footage on youtube compare npcs ai react to you in this game vs other openworld games the enemy ai is too easy i know i made point that is good for you to create your build but it doesnt to be too easy tho when you stealth the ai its so stupid and the hacking mechanic made it even easier tbf i cant blame them for the game become too easy when im stealth because lot of openworld action games that have stealth as an option most of them never get it right cause the main focus is the combat enemy ai they dont have any tactic to fight the player theyre main 4 type of enemy in this game theyre 3 human type and robot type or was it an android i dont remember actuallyhuman melee range and netrunner robot melee and range is not so different from these type of games although they can quick dash in this game the most interesting one would be netrunner that try to hack you to make your system overheat to deal with them you need to find them and interrupt the hacking before they can successfully hack you but when ai is too easy is not hard to deal with the combat and gunplay is mediocre its nothing new which is fine i dont mind it its better than fallout 4 tho i think cause i remember that i dont like gunplay in that game that much gangs of night city this is the one thing that they promote it as if its main thing about this game in the main story i dont feel like they matter at allonly voodoo boys important role in the story but i wish there were more i dont to get too much into the story but there are so little about them they have lore and character design and everything for them but never use it to full potential which it really disappointed and i wish when you fight them in combat i wish they fight differently from each gang but nope they fight the same way in every gang loot system is boring im not an expert or game dev or anything i just feel is boring thats all and i dont have any idea why and how to make it fun to loot rpg system oh please its kinda rpg i dont know actually maybe because the skill tree doesnt actually offer anything new most of them are just increase 10 damage which is boring tbh i think far cry 3 skill tree better unique skill to offer to players more than this but yeah i know this is an rpg games not openworld sandbox crafting and upgrade mechanic is really pointless in my playthrough and the game never encourage to use it even if you play as techie build is still not that good cause you will find new item that is better than your anyway i could be wrong with this one i might need to do another play to go full techie build but for now i dont feel like it ui is hard to navigate especially the message window and there are many vehicle for you to buy in this game and it will add to your mission log but it doesnt show picture of vehicle which is pretty annoying that i have to go through all message window to figure it out which one is the car that i want to buy why cant i buy vehicle from anywhere in the map why do i have to go to specific location this is 2077 life path this is the thing that i really disappoint about this game first when they show to us that life path is the key for multiple playthrough well is that true nope its the same matter life path that you choose vs character heshe is the same person doesnt matter which life path you choose although there are some unique dialogue depends on life path which is feel great when its there but it doesnt change anything that much in the story dialogue choice just like life path it doesnt change anything much you just choose for v to say something different form other choice that you have but it doesnt impact or change anything your action will impact the world around you yeah right when defeat the boss in the story there will be an option to spare or kill the boss which most of them are pointless cause you will never see them again in the story your ending choice will available from what side job have you done which is not bad but i think it choose include the dialogue choice during story to impact ending option as wellsummary i dont hate this game this game is good game wout performance issue rn ofc but it still not the game in trailer that cdpr keep pushing hype with night city wire and i dont want to add more thing into the list cause its gon na more nitpicking from i would still recommend this game even with many flaws i have with it wait for the game on sale and more stable than what it is rnso i give this game 25 its fine game but its not

well i did it i finished soulstype game am i glad i did it yes i think so would i go back and do it again if i could probably not not for very very long time anywaysseriously its obviously wellmade high quality game but man does it have some issueswarning this review is more of vent than anything i actually do think its decent game just not worthy of the hype its garnered the combat is based almost entirely around timing and learning enemy attack patterns this isnt problem in and of itself the right kind of player would love learning the precise time to press space against each kind of enemy however i am not that kind of player i like to play basebuilder type games and occasionally mix in some hackandslash rpg and shooter titles when i dont feel like thinking too hard if im going to put in effort to master game i like to do it by planning my moves ahead of time and experimenting with the tools im given not by mastering each inthemoment microtwitch movement if youre like and flipflop between games like team fortress 2 and factorio id recommend staying away from this onehowever i think that the timingbased combat where one of the games first huge problems rears its ugly head for game so heavily based on timing and careful movement it some awfully laggy inputs dodgeroll one of the most important moves in the game delay on it about half second between when you press the button and when your character even starts to move in the middle of this games tightly timed fights thats huge it took hours upon hours of wondering why dodging felt so bad before i realized what was going oneafter looking at some online guides i learned that this delay is apparently part of every souls title and that most players simply consider mastering it to be part of the challenge i suppose theyre right but think about it anyways significant portion of this games challenge finds its source in intentionally poor laggy controlsim also not sure that the developers ever heard the phrase quality of life when designing this game there are all kinds of weird inconvenient things in this game that simply defy explanation why arent the allimportant health and mana potions bound to unique key why can we only use the special effect on our righthand when we can just briefly unequip it to use our lefthand weapon why do equippedbutunused weapons add to your carry weight if youre quick with the menus its perfectly possible to keep your auxiliary weapons hidden in your inventory and then only equip them when needed so why make us deal with the carry weight issue is rapidclicking through menus supposed to be another combat skill we masterand i think i would be amiss if i didnt point out the poor early gameplay progression of sorceryintelligence charactersi picked the astrologer starting class since i felt like playing spellslinger i booted into the game and started looking for better gear but nothing i tried everything i could think of i followed the path the game sent down nothing i headed east to the higher level area new spells new staffs still nothing it was beyond the twenty hour mark that i finally got new staff as random drop from an enemy in the high level area and it was garbage literally worse than my starting weapon unless you happened to be using one or two ultraniche rock breaker spells and i only found them found those hours and hours later stillit was only when friend clued in to their location that i was finally able to get my hands on some better spells although they were actually pretty close to the starting area theres nothing directing you there if you happen to miss the one particular set of ruins where the vendor is hiding youre screwed new spells for ageseven then it was probably past the fifty hour mark that i finally found staff able to replace the starting staff which by then i had upgraded to be better than most nonunique staffs and hours more before i hit the minimum level to use itlet emphasize something my friend told where to get better spells i started this game determined not to look at the wikis i tend to be really bad about that using wikis to look up secrets however this was not the game with which i should have made that resolution because to paraphrase that same friends words this is game meant to be played with the wiki open on second monitornow we reach the crux of the games design flaws this entire game is made of secrets like seriously im not sure that its possible for single player to complete single side quest in this game without looking up instructions on the wiki at least not without spending hours upon hours upon hours scouring every last corner of the map for the next arbitrary npc location and talking with every character second and third times to make sure that some new dialog option hasnt appeared even characters who supposedly actively want your help will barely tell you what they want or even why you should help them eg one character upon first meeting will ask for your help in her war against the erdtree at this point in the game i still barely even knew what the erdtree was other than really tall and glowing there is option to ask her why she wants war against the erdtree or how even her cryptic assassinations quests help to combat the erdtreethat character was nothing but small contributor to what i consider to be the games single biggest problem this game is so cryptic so utterly and incomprehensibly obtuse and obsessed with secrets that i dont think i could have told you what the plot was had i not read it on the wiki everything else i could have forgiven if the story had just yknow made sensewhats your characters motivation when you start the game you are greeted with cutscene instructing you to become elden lord why who is my character why did they just wake up in this temple was the voice in the cutscene something my character experienced as far as i can tell this is the story of some psychopath who wakes up and immediately goes on rampage killing half the remaining lucid people in this undead wasteland and subjugating the other half part of the fun of an openworld game is supposed to be learning about the world meeting its people and seeing how they live in elden ring though the world seems to be nothing more than setpiece pretty backdrop while you ride between dungeon to boss fight to dungeon there are people who like this stuff lore junkies who will spend hours making crazy theory videos on youtube however if after playing through whole game i cant identify any motive other than go kill stuff and get stronger so you can sit on the chair next to the big tree i think there might be problemthe games problems can be summed up in one fight maliketh apparently you fight him to get something called destined death what is that its never explained cryptic lore moves incredibly fast and your attack windows are comically slim janky timings forget malenia this is the real hardest boss in the game however theres secret item that exists specifically to fight him youd be lucky to find the item without going to the wiki and looking it up and even if you did find it youd be hardpressed to figure out how to use it wiki on other screen kills you quick fights tend to last less than minute however the nearest respawn point is thirty second walk away there is reason it couldnt have been right next to the boss door it didnt add any challenge all it did was make the boss take longer quality of lifetldr if you just want to git good at fighting big bosses in pretty landscape this game is for you otherwise maybe dont believe the hype,Recomendado,1,7564,14,Negativo,[],"['Problemas de control y lag en la jugabilidad', 'Dificultad para progresar con personajes de hechicería/inteligencia',

the short i didnt really think what everyone was clamoring for was the ubisoftification of dark souls the long prosjump buttonmusichorse combat mostlyfunaddictiveconsshockingly laggymovement is jankthe world seems very emptystamina consumption feels randomgraphics are often ugly and washed outditches many of the better systems from previous gameswalked back some of the better ideas from the network testsflailingyou need the wikiwhere did my legs go why did my monitor stop working it crashed again mostly its dark souls 3 but bigger and with extra tat tacked on and yet somehow the whole thing feels bit cheap its big mostly empty open world with dodgy traversal mechanics the few hours i played were mostly hiding in bushes collecting flowers the new sneaking around can be fun in an assassins creed way but in the one camp i found enemies tend to be in line of site of one another and the backstab is slow enough to leave you open from what little i saw you cant really build character around stealth before too long i found gatehouse where the archer can spot you through cover and bosses boss adjacent monsters really wont let you get away with it like in the aforementioned ubisoft sandboxes really the game is done favors comparing it to assassins creed as its often very ugly game assets pop in creatures disappear and all the colors feel very washed out thats not uncommon for from software games but from the character creation screen it looked like marked improvement over ds3 sadly in game models are low rez with larger ones having hard corners that show the limited poly count many assets seem to be copy pasted giving the whole experience very cheap feel not helped by the fact that the prolog is slideshow makes wonder what could be causing all the lag i dont mind dyeing in souls game but when lag keeps killing im gon na be bit cross its very odd too i have pretty high end pc and can run much much better looking games on ultra without issue the early on supposed to loose fight bugged out so badly that the thing faded to black before i took any damage it stayed that way long enough that i thought it had crashed until i saw the loading symbol for an uncomfortably long time that alone would be an issue worth waiting for patch to buy but the controls are janky too there didnt seem to be analog sensitivity adjustment so had to keep switching out controllers until i found one that didnt interrupt walking across the room in straight line how could this have happened they nailed this before yeah so the elephant in the room here is sekironot just sekiro but well get to that traversal stealth and combat improvements miles above any of the souls games were all there but they ditched them for some reason im not saying we needed grappling hook but why make the jumps so awkward and imprecise all the low ledges and walls seem to encourages jumping but its very unclear as to what can be vaulted over like sekiro it does embrace the idea that movement doesnt consume stamina sort of it does when youre in combat though that can be somewhat academic due to the poor stealth system and other factors i couldnt place sekiro also nailed parrying blocking and dodging and by that i mean they were balanced enough so that they were all useful the perilous attacks system was spectacular way to engage foes unlike most soulsborn games you really had to parry yet for some reason we are for the most part back to dark souls 3 style block dodge and parries so inexact your better off not bothering reviews keep saying its culmination of all from software learned but its seems more like picknmix of middling ideas even if you didnt want to pull from sekiro for the combat why ignore the other games the only presence from dark souls 2 seems to be the double weapons nice to have but hardly that games best feature they seem to keep doing this dark souls was great for its time but dark souls 2 and bloodborn greatly refined the formula yet dark souls 3 seems to have contained none of what made those games better and here again here as in ds3 we are awash in samey weapons i though bb taught you dozen well designed weapons are better then way way too many swords parrying especially needed to look to these three titles ds2 made nigh everything parryable and gave you big window to counter bb made parrying at range possible and sekiro made it fluid enough that it was always strong option here were back to ds3s parrying is here but blocking or dodging is still more viable in truth this game is proof to they failed to learn from themselves but theyre not even looking to what their peers have done during the network tests leveling strength gave you the ability to wear heavier armor as in the nioh gameswhich let mutable stats dictate this but they switch it back to only endurance granting more carry weight why it makes more sense for the strength based character to have heavier armor strength scaling weapons often have slower windups and longer punishes as result you may have to soak hit to land blow it was good idea it had been proven to work in other soulslike games and they cut it out on that note wheres the rallying system got to that was such great feature ive seen it crop up in many other games is it hidden somewhere in this overstuffed mess i could go on i played this game for about five hours and while it felt longer than that i dont think i really got anywhere in point of fact i think ive already gone on too long but its all kind of moot as my primary issue is that its just kinda boring i mean havent we been here before ive never started new from software game and within hour im reaching for podcast i want more sekiro more bloodborn heck id even take more dark souls 2 but just dont want whatever this is update after many hours i did get into it the horse combat helped as it is largely very fun but everything comes with caveat the mounted sections are good until you get arbitrarily knocked off your alpaca now that is admittedly annoying but whats worse is theres nothing you can do about it theres barding you can equip on your beast and while the game says putting points into dexterity helps keep you from falling off im at 60 dex and i dont see much difference also it would only sort of mater if there was huge difference as you cant as far as i can tell actively do anything to increases your fluffy friends hp getting knocked off your horse is often instant death as you just lie on the ground for an age waiting to be mauled its not unlike youve had the controller torn from your hand and it is held out of reach until you are ether killed or are obscenely low on health and just to put cherry on the alpaca manure sunday when your fine beasty does inevitably die you have to use health potion to revive them by way of menu prompt asking are you sure you want to bring your only chance of survival back from the dead at the megger cost of one of your many easily replenished items yeah im pretty forking sure elden ring except dont bother because i died battling with your superfluous text box again keeping with caveats the bosses are often quite fun despite their copy paste nature but some just wont let up id say learn their pattern but that only maters if they ever take break dark souls 2 got critisised for having too many foes per encounter but ill take that over half of them having hyper combo by far your best option is to find your favorite utterly broken spell consumable ash of war etctheres shortage and use it as crutch when the game decides to change the ru,No

upon booting up elden ring youre immediately given glimpse of what is to come through the brilliant soundtrack starting off with few disparate calm strings the main theme slowly morphs into an epic melody of grandeur valor and unrelenting ambition despite having already heard this track in trailers i was blown away shattered even i knew i was in for something special blissful explorationwhereas previous soulsborne titles had you trudging through claustrophobic sewers and maddening towns elden ring is far bigger more ambitious adventure reaching across numerous regions the lands between are massive and filled with things to discover even after 20 hours i was still finding new things in the first area perhaps i had missed cave tucked away in canyon or failed to peruse nearby forest once i even stumbled upon an expansive underground area that you could easily miss its magical really much of the wonder comes from the design ethos gone are the myriad of question markers and intrusive quest logs you would find in other titles instead replaced by something as simple as your own curiosity fromsoftware uses this as tool to compel you forward when you see fort in the distance you will feel urged to go there and the best thing is that it was you and not the game that decided so elden ring relies on your participation and i love that httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2790286880as you traverse these lands its hard not to be impressed by the topography uneven hills and deep gorges combine to create world that can not simply be navigated by holding down your left joystick its gargantuan structures serving not just to undermine you but also as waypoints on your journey it made realize how flat and easygoing the landscapes in open worlds often are in the lands between even the geography is your adversary constantly bending and defying rules my first 30 hours with elden ring were some of the best ive had in gaming and i was ready to name it fromsoftwares magnum opus but then realization dawned wait havent i seen this church beforethere are many reasons to love the soulsborne titles but one of them is the handcrafted quality that permeates throughout every corner of the world feels like it was designed with specific purpose in mind one that you would probably understand through your ponderings and each encounter offered new challenge these were games that not only encourage you to explore but also feature enough secrets to warrant doing so this still rings true here but for every two surprises there was moment of utter disappointment reused structures and bosses are frequent to the point where every foe not overtly important to the narrative will be fought multiple times it also undermines the sense of discovery since you can only happen upon so many identical dilapidated churches before you wonder if its worth it this is truest for the many dungeons and caves they all have the same visual identity and rarely differ in terms of enemies and i have hard time naming just one of them since they all blend into one large portion of copypaste tedium eventually i began looking at these as optional bonus levels rather than integral parts of the world and honestly i think that is the best approach it is also in this repetition that the developers misunderstand what made their bosses so special in the first place like telling joke these encounters require careful buildup harrowing walk through town gone mad or slowly making your way up castle the bosses were never the main attraction they served as final sendoffs stages of thrilling and heartpounding action to juxtapose the relatively quiet exploration this still applies to the linear locations but once you step into the open world miyazaki starts hurling bosses at you like hes kid training for sports match thats not to say the boss fights are bad when you come across one of the more sophisticated fights and composer yuka kitamura starts sending symphonic shockwaves through your ears this game is delightful with few exceptions the mandatory encounters are consistently astounding and satisfyingly grueling rounded off by exquisitely rich and repulsive visual design these moments are truly special httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2790285862elden ring keeps on going just when you think youve seen it all it turns out theres still another half of the story left had it featured enough content to sustain this length it couldve been monumental achievement unfortunately that is not the case theres an entire region where the only unique foe is the boss at the end the rest being awkwardly recycled enemies and one of the best places in the game suffers from similar issueyet i cant help but love elden ring for weeks i was enthralled by its world and when i wasnt playing it i was thinking about where to explore next or how to approach the boss i was stuck on when i present these criticisms of the game its not because i despise it its because i care had this been disappointment i wouldve just shrugged and thought little more of it beauty and hostilitythrough the lands between fromsoftware toys with an interesting dichotomy while the landscapes are gorgeous and downright breathtaking they are far from safe mercenaries in tattered armor oversized crustaceans draconian soldiers the size of giants and even living jars everyone and everything is out to kill you even if there arent many enemies specific to one region there are still plenty of creative enemy designs the open world also gives you lot of freedom in how you approach these you could sneak your way through an enemy camp get up close and personal with comically large greatsword or ride in on your horse slashing wildly at anyone in your way this makes the notorious difficulty far more approachable and id imagine that more people will finish the game because of it the combat system itself is akin to dark souls 3 but there are enough additions to make it not feel worn out and dreary sekiros posture system where an enemys stance can be broken to leave them vulnerable been subtly integrated the enemies dont have wavering stamina bars over their heads but this means you arent pressured into style of play the stance mechanic is there you can use it if you want but it can also be ignored entirely httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2790286283when combined the stance system and guard counter result in battles coming across more as duels than the old hitandrun affair there were times where i had to run away either to heal or get break from the heat of battle but i spent considerably more time facing my enemy headon you could argue that not enforcing these improvements leads to some players resorting to the triedandtested tactics but i like the freedom it brings another enemy you will face is the performance while the game runs at 60fps most of the time there are some drastic problems with frame pacing and stuttering i didnt find it too distracting but those on lowerend pcs might be more affected its hard not to compare elden rings selection of enemies and locations to previous fromsoftware offerings but part of believes we should look at it through different lens for while it is like these in certain departments its also title that seeks to provide different experience one much more flexible in its design contours and of much grander scale rather than scold it for the ways it compares we should appreciate it for the ways it differs visit cup of

my review of cyberpunk 2077so ill start off by saying that i am huge fan of the witcher universe and especially the witcher 3 ive read the books and thoroughly played the game i was big fan of the company behind it as we all know cdpr naturally i was looking forward to cp2077 almost 8 years in development constant updates and promising future i was skeptical for the first delay but decided to allow it i told myself that as long as the game was polished and perfect id wait morethe first sign of problemsthe game was delayed again and although they did upload an email of sorts explaining the reasoningi knew something was up they upbig time they didnt manage the time well and there was something going on that we didnt know about spoilers performance issues and unpolished features then it was delayed third time so i was 100 sure they were running out of time main problemscyberpunk 2077 was supposed to be game in bustling metropolis of the futurea true next gen experience with many many features amazing graphics story great sidequests and features like inviting your friends over or having interesting interactions with npcs at least thats what we were promised the game arrived full of problems i am not just talking about the insane amount of bugs performance issues especially on consoles but the lack of an actual ai system and immense lack of other features like indepth character customization replayability ability customization different outcomes depending on background and of course ingame relationships with other npcs such as friendsaithe ai is by far the worst ai i have ever seen in aaa game the npcs spawn right in front of you out of thin air and disappear the same way that is not by any means the intelligent next gen ai we were promised where are the routines and daily lives of the citizens of this city rdr2 did it and is considered an old gen title not next gen like cp2077 was supposed to be the ai is so stupid i cant even put it into words i feel like im playing cheap imitation of game the police just spawn wherever you are even on rooftops its so disappointing i am very confident even an inter programmer could make better ai system than this sorry excuse all in all i would give the ai system 310 merely because there is one to begin withcharacter customizationthe character customization is once again feature we were promised with great detail especially we would be able to fully customize our characters to fit our ideal model what we were given was generic customization menu we were just given some options we could select hairstyle eye color hair color beards thats about it it is not indepth at all to add to that you rarely even look at your character ingame even if you did there are barbers in night city in case you want to change the way you look feature that the witcher 3 game created 5 years ago on top of all this the clothing in this game is meaningless everyone just selects the clothes with the highest stats making them practically useless next time you open this game take look at your character you probably look like clown that ran away from the circus because the higher level you become the better the drops are and frankly im very disappointed once againreplayabilityat the moment i have 58 hours in the game and feel need whatsoever to replay it i went with typical netrunner build because i found it interesting i feel like ive experienced almost everything this game to offer in terms of combat at the starting levels i was forced into using guns like assault rifles and even played with the melee weapons to see how they felt until my netrunning abilities improved because it is lategame build during that time i experienced the combat the way other builds would the gun play is so boring you just spray into the enemies until they die the other builds just have better damage in terms of numbers the only fun gun i actually used was the revolver while doing stealth the melee weapons are the same you just spam mouse 1 until the enemy dies there is real skill or interesting aspect and before you ask about mantis blades and such they are the same as other melee weapons you just smash your buttons until the enemy dies i wouldnt call this replayability because it just simply doesnt have anything unique to provideabilities buildsas noted previously the abilities were also disappointing at least in the netrunning section apart from some hacking abilities that did different types of damage there was pretty much nothing else all the upgrades are just number changes the feature of enemy weakness isnt even needed personally i just spammed my hacks until all the baddies were dead showing indifference towards their weaknesses played on hard difficulty i wish i am wrong about this but i feel like even the other builds have similar problem you get more attack speed more damage more critical chance and damage and thats about as far as abilities gobackgroundthe background of choice does in way affect the gameplay all you get is meaningless dialogue options that do not change any part of the story there are unique skills abilities or characteristics unique to backgrounds its just another meaningless option you select at the beginning of your game does not even affect romance optionsleisure activitiesthis game is supposed to be situated inside city of course and notorious at that night city night city is dead on the inside there is nothing interesting to do in gta v you can go for tennis go to the casino go play golf watch movie and many many other activities cyberpunk 2077 zero activities outside of side quests and even the sidequests were few compared to the witchers 3 sidequests that were even in my opinion more interesting at times than cyberpunksthe good things of this gamethere are some things in this game that i did actually find enjoyable though firstly the music is amazing i loved the songs samurai did which were actually from band called refused the music really fits the setting and i think its one of the few things they got rightthe story was also alright i did not find it amazing but i liked it the events were well knitted into one another and the endings were not what everyone expected spoilers aheadthe sad endings of our story is something i will remember they were really really well done and took by surprise the story of jackies death and us trying matter what to survive was interesting to say the least becoming data inside mikoshi or living our last months either with panam and the aldecaldos or staying in night city are not the endings i had anticipatedi think i will remember them for long timebut that is as far as the story will take it the city feels deadconclusionwhile i had some expectations i was careful not to fall into the hype train i anticipated for the game to be good experience with the necessary features that were promised to make this experience good we were given sorry excuse of game after 7 months of delay cdpr presented an unfinished game with lots of issues do not fool yourself and blame the programmers and developers they have been in cruch for over year the witcher 3 had the same issue and honestly its shame that in 2020 workers are forced into such inhumane situtations to those defending the developers because gamers couldnt wait you are fool at best we were lied to again and again only to be disappointed in the end if you can enjoy this gamegood for you but for and many others this is something i can not forgive so easily wait for improvement before buying,No

the effort it takes to enjoy cyberpunk 2077 is monumental nothing in cyberpunk 2077 stands up to anything but the most cursory scrutiny you wind your way through lively city streets packed with

go back to sleep samurai they have game to patch wise man once said delayed game is eventually good but rushed game is forever bad thankfully we arent in the 90s anymore and games can be patched and fixed so this quote is less relevant for gaming now but man do the developers at cdpr have their work cut out for them the thing is though the player only gets one first playthrough and if it is marred by bugs poor performance and glitches then it is not going to be as enjoyablememorable than if it was thoroughly finished game i did enjoy my time with this and still think it is good game but it is far from solid game at the moment welcome to night city vs story through night city is the games biggest strength the writing characters and the way conversations play out makes for an incredibly engaging story the dynamic between v and johnny silverhand is great and the other characters are just as good and welldeveloped jackie judy panam takemura viktor river and even the antagonists maelstrom in particular all have their own motives interests history ambitions that made so fascinated in their lives and build connection with each the side jobs involving each of these characters continued that great writing and was some of the best content in the game river wards and peralez questline being highlight but there is also memorable content that doesnt involve the main cast such as sentient vending machine or talking handgun wanting to be returned to its owner however the problem with the side content is that they are all marked as undiscovered on the map so it is basically impossible to distinguish the good content from the boring and repetitive gigs i did enjoy the story and quests but let just say that im big fan of the cyberpunk genre with government conspiracies high tech low life philosophy thoughtprovoking questions relating to our world and all that unfortunately this game barely touches on the tropes of cyberpunk like transhumanism its all just surface level and i get that they based it moreso on the tabletop but i wouldve loved it if they embraced the genre more the city of dreams lets move on to the gameplay and this is where the game stumbles firstly there are your roleplaying and openworld elements it your standard level up system and placing points into one of the five attributes body intelligence reflexes cool and technical ability can open up different ways to access areas dialogue options or perks cyberware is big part of this game offering up variety of modifications to each body section to suit your playstyle to name few you can equip gorilla arms or mantis blades for closequarters combat enhanced cyberdecks for those that enjoy hacking smart links to be able to curve bullets or more general enhancements that increase armour health or stamina dialogue choices may influence the story slightly discovering information in shards can open up dialogue options and such but it is not on the level of divinity original or fallout new vegas more on par with witcher 3s style the openworld elements are lacking or outright missing though some of which should be staple for any openworld game ive heard others describe night city as vast as the ocean deep as puddle and i couldnt agree more there is lot of attention to detail to make each area unique from the skyscrapers to dinky alleyways but once you start looking deeper into it the cracks become noticeable the way the ai behaves is terrible the bad wanted system minigames wheres my cybergwent and there is just lack of interactivity within the city cant sit down and eat at food vendor cant play the arcade machines cant gamble cant customise your apartment vehicles or hairstyle whoever sets up barber shop in night city would make thousands of eddies it just makes appreciate rockstar games more for the amount of effort they put into their worlds to make them come alive the combat isnt bad but it just doesnt do anything great while the weapons feel satisfying to use especially the smart weapons the combat against the braindead ai just isnt all that fun for example you can casually walk up to an enemy in cover and they do not know how to react or they rush you without any regard to their own wellbeing the stealth and hacking are fine and is good alternative for those that enjoy that style of gameplay but i honestly couldnt get into it because it was even less fun than just shooting enemies it may get better as you level up but i didnt feel the incentive to try hacking access points with breach protocol is pretty boring as well where you have to input the code in the right order deus ex human revolutionmankind divided did much better job at making hacking more engaging the driving is terrible and doesnt feel natural the cars have too much oversteer when turning and handle like boats another annoyance being that the minimap doesnt zoom out when driving so i was constantly missing turns and im big dreamer now to visuals and sound this is definitely great looking game when it is working at 100 weapon models and animations are highly detailed and flashy along with the abundance of vehicles all designed meticulously character models look fantastic with realistic looking movement and facial animations that just help to immerse into the game the issue is that bugs and glitches break that immersion constantly it is incredibly jarring to see fluid animations during conversations with main characters only to walk past dude tposing faces missing or cars stuck in the air like it is rocket league 2077 the soundtrack is awesome the guns sound impactful to shoot melee weapons have solid feel to them as well the vehicles sound great as well voice acting done by the main cast is fantastic keanu suits johnny well although i played as male v and his voice acting was bit underwhelming i heard female v is lot better so if you want more rounded performance pick her conclusion in conclusion this is an enjoyable game that is hampered from being great for various reasons mentioned above just remember you only get one first playthrough so dont let it be ruined by an unpolished buggy game wait couple of months for it to be patched and tidied up this is why im leaving not recommended for now i do intend to go through second time and try different builds and endings but i dont think i can due to how messy it is at the moment once it is all fixed ill come back to it and if it turned into more complete game ill change it to recommended in the meantime go and clear that backlog of games that you swore to get around to edit patch 12what can i say its good first step for the long road ahead but i think i was way too optimistic saying itll be tidied up and better in couple of months i shouldve said couple of years there are some improvements but overall there is still lot jank driving is lot better more ridiculous oversteer or floaty controls some visual bugs are fixed didnt see any tposing or missing faces however now i have bug where v equips fingergun rather than pistolrevolver and holds shotguns with one hand i realise i put all my stats into body but really police spawn 15 metres away rather than 5 but still police chases although somehow i managed to get into situation with random npc thugs chasing in their cars outside of missions so it must be somewhere in the code what do i know though i

go back to sleep samurai they have game to patch wise man once said delayed game is eventually good but rushed game is forever bad thankfully we arent in the 90s anymore and games can be patched and fixed so this quote is less relevant for gaming now but man do the developers at cdpr have their work cut out for them the thing is though the player only gets one first playthrough and if it is marred by bugs poor performance and glitches then it is not going to be as enjoyablememorable than if it was thoroughly finished game i did enjoy my time with this and still think it is good game but it is far from solid game at the moment welcome to night city vs story through night city is the games biggest strength the writing characters and the way conversations play out makes for an incredibly engaging story the dynamic between v and johnny silverhand is great and the other characters are just as good and welldeveloped jackie judy panam takemura viktor river and even the antagonists maelstrom in particular all have their own motives interests history ambitions that made so fascinated in their lives and build connection with each the side jobs involving each of these characters continued that great writing and was some of the best content in the game river wards and peralez questline being highlight but there is also memorable content that doesnt involve the main cast such as sentient vending machine or talking handgun wanting to be returned to its owner however the problem with the side content is that they are all marked as undiscovered on the map so it is basically impossible to distinguish the good content from the boring and repetitive gigs i did enjoy the story and quests but let just say that im big fan of the cyberpunk genre with government conspiracies high tech low life philosophy thoughtprovoking questions relating to our world and all that unfortunately this game barely touches on the tropes of cyberpunk like transhumanism its all just surface level and i get that they based it moreso on the tabletop but i wouldve loved it if they embraced the genre more the city of dreams lets move on to the gameplay and this is where the game stumbles firstly there are your roleplaying and openworld elements it your standard level up system and placing points into one of the five attributes body intelligence reflexes cool and technical ability can open up different ways to access areas dialogue options or perks cyberware is big part of this game offering up variety of modifications to each body section to suit your playstyle to name few you can equip gorilla arms or mantis blades for closequarters combat enhanced cyberdecks for those that enjoy hacking smart links to be able to curve bullets or more general enhancements that increase armour health or stamina dialogue choices may influence the story slightly discovering information in shards can open up dialogue options and such but it is not on the level of divinity original or fallout new vegas more on par with witcher 3s style the openworld elements are lacking or outright missing though some of which should be staple for any openworld game ive heard others describe night city as vast as the ocean deep as puddle and i couldnt agree more there is lot of attention to detail to make each area unique from the skyscrapers to dinky alleyways but once you start looking deeper into it the cracks become noticeable the way the ai behaves is terrible the bad wanted system minigames wheres my cybergwent and there is just lack of interactivity within the city cant sit down and eat at food vendor cant play the arcade machines cant gamble cant customise your apartment vehicles or hairstyle whoever sets up barber shop in night city would make thousands of eddies it just makes appreciate rockstar games more for the amount of effort they put into their worlds to make them come alive the combat isnt bad but it just doesnt do anything great while the weapons feel

spoilersthis is one of those games where you wish steam had more than just yes or for reviews get ready for an excessive amount of commas because its time to dump some thoughtsmost of it boils down to the massive amount of bugs in the game gamebreaking and otherwise lets be real here it needed at least another six months of pure bug squashing before releasei dont know if the people that claim to have encountered zero bugs are incredibly lucky unobservant or just straight up lying i must have encountered at least hundred different bugs in under 10 hours of gameplay im not exaggerating here thankfully only three of those were gamebreaking bugs requiring to load previous save in order to continue playing with the rest being visual audio and gameplay bugs i havent experienced single crash in the time ive played so it that going for it list of bugs ive experienced at the end of the reviewcontrols are bit of mess as well because of the fairly low framerate throughout the game mouse movement feels choppy and sluggish to in addition to this the game keeps hijacking the players camera to focus on events or items which works fine on consoles but is terrible experience on kbm the keybinds also leave lot to be desired there are lot of unnecessarily separated and oddly bound keys for example numkeys 1 and 3 are used to cycle through cameras c is used for both crouch and skip diologue double tapping movement key makes you dodge and various other oddities i like to explore while characters talk and often ended up accidentally skipping fair few lines of conversation before getting fed up and changing the binds ive also fallen off rooftops and jumped out of cover by accidentally double tapping movement key microadjustments for positioning are essential so unintentional dodging is unavoidable then theres the leaning keybinds which are completely missing you can autolean by getting up close to some cover but i have yet to find game where this doesnt feel wrong on kbm i think they made an honest attempt to adapt the controls to pc but the game was clearly designed for controllers as far as graphics options go its good port very customizable and includes all the newer toys like dlss and thats good thing because dlss in particular is pretty much requirement to get playable fps the graphics look good but not good enough to justify the terrible performance obviously this will improve as new hardware comes out but i feel like they bit off more than anyone else can chew with this one for those who are fine with an inconsistent 3060fps and horrible graphics youll probably have fine time i play on an rtx 2070 super i77700k 1440p 144hz monitor installed on an ssd with dlss enabled auto ray tracing disabled and most of the settings at low or medium i also tested the game on older nvidia drivers as well as the most recent one crashing on either i switched between 1080p and 1440p often but saw negligable difference in framerate i managed to get anywhere from 30 to 70fps around the city and barely up to 100fps in some isolated missions i cant tell if the game is unoptimized or if they have too much on screen at once or both it doesnt really matter because you will need to play it in potato mode to keep the choppiness to minimum this is still far better than consoles especially when you utilize the expansive options we have on pc but not an ideal experience in any wayso i guess that brings to the gameplay and story spoilers still im not basing this review on the story overall because i havent played through the whole thing yet so far yeah its fine i like the characters and i enjoy the gunplay i even did some hacking and sneaking not my normal thing and it was good time inventory management is my least favorite thing in the world but theres plenty of inventory space and the weight limit isnt much of an issue if you allocate points in the right skill tree unfortunately i do still find myself picking over every single prop in the room looking for items even during gunfights i wish i could just focus on the shooting but theres so freakin many items to loot how can i focus on the enemy when theres loot to be hadi knew that

i have been thinking of writing review for this game for long time i love cyberpunk 2077 but as of writing this review june 17th 2021 v122 i can not recommend it as whole experience with clear conscience i will update the review once something changesupdate there been number of patches since i wrote this review but they did not address the issues i mentionlets start with the good things like i said i love the game and i do love it for lot of things but the most important one is potential the game potential to be great one of the greatest games in the genre but its not fulfilling it at the moment for now i see it as skeleton of game that it can be but the core elements that are there are very strong these elements are the main story and side storylines world building and auxiliary storytelling characters setting the aesthetic and visual design gameplay music both inradio and ambient soundtrack the list could go onnow on to the bad things im not going to discuss bugs in this review sure enough they arent good but 1 i believe the game much bigger problems and 2 i believe those will get ironed out with time with each new updatei believe the games biggest problem is the immersion factor and that term encompasses large area of the game so im going to point some of them out and what i think would be better alternative1 low amount of customization optionssure enough the character creator is quite expansive but customization extends to more things than just vs physical appearance we are talking guns cars and bikes apartments haircuts and tattoos cyberware etc2 lifeless and stupid npcsnpcs in cyberpunk exist only as filler to the world they have purpose routines just occupying screen space they spawn and despawn as you turn around turn around and start walking in opposite direction when theres something in their way react unrealistically to traffic or gunfire traffic npc ai is even worse they wont go around any obstacle matter how slight sometimes just plain stop in the middle of the road for reason swerve around lanes not react properly to traffic lights it goes onthere also are nonstory npcs that you can talk to not including vendors im not saying every pedestrian needs to have full dialogue wheel but there should be people you can talk to that arent part of quest in some way3 corporate manufacturing and street marketsthe theme of the game is how everything is ran by corporations and these corporations produce things mostly arms and if you look around the city you can see they have their branded stores i think that it would be great for immersion if these stores were functional and stocked with weaponry manufactured by that corporation for example corp produces power rifles and body armor corp b flamethrowers light machine guns and grenade launchers corp c specializes in blades all the katanas kukris knives axes etc and you need to visit specific manufacturers store to pick up specific weapon type you should be able to customize your gun when purchasing like changing the skin and getting attachments and on the counter side of the corpo stores would be street markets where you can buy preowned iron maybe it already scope on it or some paint and stickers its probably not as good as brand new toy but at least its not sold at 3000 markup4 cyberware and body modsthe current system of getting cyberware is very underwhelming i was very excited for feature that was teased in the demo before the game came out that feature was humanity cost that was associated with getting an implant alongside the price and street cred requirement it was implied that different implants have different humanity costs the greater the modification the greater the cost for example lowkey kiroshi eyeball implant would have significantly lower humanity cost than maelstromlike visor replacing half of your face but would also not offer as much utility we dont know how having high and low humanity cost would affect the game but i pictured it to be nuanced and interesting systemthat leads to the next thing about implants its that they barely change your appearance the only mods that change your look are arms and hands mods we should be given lot more options of heavy body modificationsthere also is the lack of animations you just open the shopping window buy the implant and youre good to go there should be an animation every time you get an implant installed similar to the first scene at vikswhen it comes to buying and selling cyberware the corporate stores dont make that much sense here like they do with the guns since ripperdocs are running their independent clinics they can stock with whatever they want or whatever they can get there should be topoftheline clinics with best brandnew implants and scroungier chopshops where maybe its bit more mixandmatch like cyber arm put together from different parts but itll get the job done5 fashionbefore the game dropped there was lot of teasing going on one of the teasers were snaps of night city fashion and the 4 main dressing styles prevalent in the city which indicated that your choice of clothes is important in the city of dreams meanwhile clothing selection is pretty limited and clothes serve simply as armor i would have much rather have armor stat be boosted only by either wearing actual body armor or by installing implants like subdermal armor and shock absorbers and have clothing be purely cosmetic6 pastimes clubs bars restaurants and food stands races fistfights bdscyberpunk desperately needs pastimes only things to do in the game are main quests side quests gigs and hustles action 100 of the time there need to be activities to do in down time you should be able to go to bar grab seat and have drink go to club and dance the night away visit restaurant and have nice meal at table or go to food stand to grab bite on the go its the little things that add up to greater whole when playing for the first time i remember reading all the websites on the net and being impressed with how complex the city is and wondering which of the coveted clubs ill visit first when i get the chance7 other immersion odds and endsi believe the choice of life path should be more impactful other than few mostly inconsequential dialogue options throughout the game as well as the life path intro part should be longer to really get feel for what life was like for v before becoming mercenary at least few missions also there should be more gigs with jackie before we do the heist to bond with the character morei think that any location marked as safehouse should allow you to access stash and sleep and maybe use mirror as wellromances are little bit shallow once the thread is over you can barely interact with your so maybe youll get some texts from them but thats about it there should be something more you can do with them after youve done their questsexploring doesnt feel rewarding because it doesnt feel like theres anything to discover the city is reminiscent of its citizens looks good but is empty on the insiderandom events selfexplanatory as of right now every event in the game world is prescriptedi think that about covers it my review of cyberpunk 2077 like i said i was thinking about it for while so theres good chance im forgetting something else i wanted to mentionif youre looking to buy the game i said

what i wish cyberpunk was truly openended rpg you can create anyone and be anyone you the player can set your own ambitions and the choices you make in the game would directly reflect who youre trying to role play your life path is more apparent ingame beyond just the opening and certain dialogue the game actually branches off into different paths and your choices make difference in the beginning and middle not just the end your choices have impact that also reflects onto the world itself as you playyou get to purchase homesapartments customize them visit futuristic autoshops to customize your cars with interesting and useful gadgets or cosmetics enter coffee shop and watch as npcs go on with their lives maybe bump into unique interactions with them walk into casino and play your hand in futuristic version of poker come across different activities that you wouldnt see in the modern world different means of transportation like subways or flying cars to get vantage view of the city entering clothes shop and actually visually trying on different clothes to have the opportunity to set yourself in this world and truly immerse yourself by having the chance to do what otherwise would seem as mundane tasks but have it become interesting because of the futuristic setting this sort of detail would create an environment and bustling city with substance and one thatd be worth returning to i wouldve hoped for more dynamic level of detail where for example you would have greater chance of stealth during nighttime or youd get dirty after hours of missions while neglecting showeringresting i never had reason to enter my apartment so why not give the players reason to these little realistic details dynamics would only add to the immersion it was surprising to that that level of detail was lacking from developers like cdprid love to see droids interacting with the world and other npcs walking the streets being vendors and interesting charactersquestgivers etc there was only taste of this with the ai taxi service ingame it wouldve been neat to see more innovative uses of tech scattered throughout the world that could demonstrate the difference in everyday life compared to the present i feel the game didnt take enough advantage of its setting to better showcase futuristic city smart law enforcement system where being issued warrant actually means you have to be wary of running into police officers in certain parts of the city and have to give effort in evading the police there shouldve also been different means of dealing with the law bribes surrender resisting getting caught and imprisoned etc and those different means could be dependent on your roleplaying builds and attributes instead i feel as though i can get away with anything and short drive around the block will clear my name wheres the depth i could go on about the different features that couldve truly enhanced this game and lot of what i wished for is actually also what cdpr also promised huge chunk of these promises were far from fulfilled though what we gotan interesting and good story decent enough combatstealth but with everything else falling at or well below average fix the bugs and this review will likely still stand im more concerned by the fundamental aspects of the game if this description doesnt change my opinion will stand vs ambition is mostly their own if you arent interested in becoming legend of night city and for example you chose nomad because youd actually prefer to be an outsider well you dont have much roleplaying say remember youre not playing your own character youre role playing v that version of v still the same goal in mind matter where you come from or what youre actually interested in the only time youll be able to express the sort of direction you want to head its at the very end when you simply choose between the different endings branching storylines is nothing more than just choosing between multiple different endings you unlock more endings simply by doing few key quest lines thats it there wasnt any impactful decision up until the very end this takes any replayability away from the game just replay the last mission and you saw everything theres reason to replay anything elseyou cant pay attention to npcs too much or itll break immersion they dont have their own daily routines they walk in circles and get scared by you simply jumping onto railing law enforcement ai is especially horrible instantly spawning on you and not really posing any challenge either npcs do lot to games environment and immersiveness it would need an entire rework to fixi know the game is meant to be dystopian but that doesnt mean night city needed to be so distasteful its empty trashy and unpleasant i wouldnt want to set foot in that city in real life i personally dont think it really captures the vibe of cyberpunk either cyberpunks world isnt much of sandbox its not really the game youd start up to just to mess around in simply because there isnt really anything to do aside from the missionsgigs unlike game like gta or rdr2 where the worlds are entertaining enough on their own tw3 was good in that regard as well so why are we taking steps backwards those aforementioned worlds were filled with detail and unique interactionsencounters you were bound to run into something you havent seen before even after hours of gameplay which made those worlds worth exploring i never felt compelled to do that in cyberpunk and when i did decide to explore anyways it just reminded of the lack of substance within night city that sandboxexploration aspect to the world was just missing and to that was both surprising and disappointingmilitary and intelligent taxi droids are there but why not drones who could sweep the city for example the city could sure use it surely they wouldve have had that sort of technology in the future again it doesnt feel like the future setting was fully taken advantage of there couldve been so much to see and experience in this setting there was definitely more room to see technological advances in playthe game felt void and heavily relied on its short story to keep the interest if the story is the only thing you value this should be enough for you cdpr are good story writers i just hoped for something more and i dont think its unfair to say that as cdpr promised difference experience verdictperhaps its at cdprs disadvantage that i and many others hold them to higher standard because of their past work at the same time i do believe the developers envisioned the game i described in the first half of this review but for whatever reasons it wasnt delivered there were so many promised features lacking that it stripped the depth and detail i was expecting the game to is just another average open world game now but with story thats above that average i couldnt say the experience was unique or amazing it was just fun and good enough to finish through youre not missing out on whole experience so i wouldnt go out of my way to recommend this game i wouldnt outright discourage it either however id only suggest to wait for more patches andor sales theres need to rush i wouldve likely given this game neutral rating if steam had that option otherwise i would only truly recommend the game that cdpr promisedin short if you told you havent played cyberpunk 2077 i wouldnt

what i wish cyberpunk was truly openended rpg you can create anyone and be anyone you the player can set your own ambitions and the choices you make in the game would directly reflect who youre trying to role play your life path is more apparent ingame beyond just the opening and certain dialogue the game actually branches off into different paths and your choices make difference in the beginning and middle not just the end your choices have impact that also reflects onto the world itself as you playyou get to purchase homesapartments customize them visit futuristic autoshops to customize your cars with interesting and useful gadgets or cosmetics enter coffee shop and watch as npcs go on with their lives maybe bump into unique interactions with them walk into casino and play your hand in futuristic version of poker come across different activities that you wouldnt see in the modern world different means of transportation like subways or flying cars to get vantage view of the city entering clothes shop and actually visually trying on different clothes to have the opportunity to set yourself in this world and truly immerse yourself by having the chance to do what otherwise would seem as mundane tasks but have it become interesting because of the futuristic setting this sort of detail would create an environment and bustling city with substance and one thatd be worth returning to i wouldve hoped for more dynamic level of detail where for example you would have greater chance of stealth during nighttime or youd get dirty after hours of missions while neglecting showeringresting i never had reason to enter my apartment so why not give the players reason to these little realistic details dynamics would only add to the immersion it was surprising to that that level of detail was lacking from developers like cdprid love to see droids interacting with the world and other npcs walking the streets being vendors and interesting charactersquestgivers etc there was only taste of this with the ai taxi service ingame it wouldve been neat to see more innovative uses of tech scattered throughout the world that could demonstrate the difference in everyday life compared to the present i feel the game didnt take enough advantage of its setting to better showcase futuristic city smart law enforcement system where being issued warrant actually means you have to be wary of running into police officers in certain parts of the city and have to give effort in evading the police there shouldve also been different means of dealing with the law bribes surrender resisting getting caught and imprisoned etc and those different means could be dependent on your roleplaying builds and attributes instead i feel as though i can get away with anything and short drive around the block will clear my name wheres the depth i could go on about the different features that couldve truly enhanced this game and lot of what i wished for is actually also what cdpr also promised huge chunk of these promises were far from fulfilled though what we gotan interesting and good story decent enough combatstealth but with everything else falling at or well below average fix the bugs and this review will likely still stand im more concerned by the fundamental aspects of the game if this description doesnt change my opinion will stand vs ambition is mostly their own if you arent interested in becoming legend of night city and for example you chose nomad because youd actually prefer to be an outsider well you dont have much roleplaying say remember youre not playing your own character youre role playing v that version of v still the same goal in mind matter where you come from or what youre actually interested in the only time youll be able to express the sort of direction you want to head its at the very end when you simply choose between the different endings branching storylines is nothing more than just choosing between multiple different endings you unlock more endings simply by doing few key quest lines thats it there wasnt any impactful decision up until the very end this takes any replayability away from the game just replay the last mission and you saw everything theres reason to replay anything elseyou cant pay attention to npcs too much or itll break immersion they dont have their own daily routines they walk in circles and get scared by you simply jumping onto railing law enforcement ai is especially horrible instantly spawning on you and not really posing any challenge either npcs do lot to games environment and immersiveness it would need an entire rework to fixi know the game is meant to be dystopian but that doesnt mean night city needed to be so distasteful its empty trashy and unpleasant i wouldnt want to set foot in

im writing this with the understanding that this is very much first impression but after playing it for five hours straight i think i have managed to play enough to form at least basic opinion about this edit ive since put bit more time into the game whilst my opinions remain mostly the same i have some better insight upon some of my feelings and have some other things to mention ill have said changes highlighted in boldive put even more time in now once more my opinions are still strong but some things have changed first and foremost its important to talk about arguably the games primary feature the narrative ill be discussing some very minor spoilers but all of this was shown in trailers years ago so i dont consider that an issue let preface this by saying that player choice and roleplaying as character are all over the place some quests are varied in their options while others are extremely linear even still there are some cases where picking the wrong dialogue option is very clearly discouraged or throws the player into an unfavorable situation for picking something out of character otherwise lot of dialogue options are simply sidecontent that doesnt progress the quest at all further the game throws you in without much explanation night citys backstory is shoved in your face lot but characters are given little time to develop i felt insulted when one of the beginning characters was introduced by six months later actionmovie style cutscene edit this dialogue flaw occurs often but not all the time even still there doesnt seem to be much choice aside from how much of jerk you want to be youre always still v this only seems to get worse once the game opens up not better even outside of the intro character investment and development is strikingly small the game does little to get to care for many of the npc before that npc subsequently disappears dies becomes hostile or otherwise stops being plot relevant i wish more characters stuck around for longer as the ones that do are rather interesting eventually i was happy to see points in which one of my characters skills could be used to bypass dialogue or as an option for quest resolution your choices do begin to matter overtime albeit only in deciding which faction you want to side with at certain points within the game some quests are definitely more linear than others even within the main story track aside from lackluster plot thus far the games world is pretty to look at but quickly loses its shine the repetitive spam of advertisements is delightfully cyberpunk and indicative of the genre but it quickly turns the games background city into an indistinguishable mess thats hard to gather much of anything from the advertisements often seem to grasp the hypersexual nature of the cyberpunk genre but do little with it aside from showing off boobs the sprawling metropolis begins to reveal its flaws very quickly as npc vehicles take turns unrealistically hard clip through objects and even run over other people crowds pop in and out of existence frequently regardless of graphical settingson that note the game runs extremely poorly i am aware that my hardware is far from the latest i7 7700k with gtx 1080 but the game struggles to break even at 50 frames with frequent dips into the 2030 fps range alongside microstuttering if it were any other game i would be more than happy to give this pass its day 1 but even hardware that is far nicer than mine appears to be struggling in some cases and after such an extended delay i am disheartened to see so many graphical visual physical and frameratebased bugs cutscenes will often freeze and stutter objects will pop inandout despite the player standing right next to them textures will unload visually and turning the camera rapidly causes considerable slowdown nearly every physicsbased option in the game is broken in some way and this can be noticed within moments i pray that these issues are fixed with hastethis would be acceptable if there was much of game underneath to enjoy but there is unfortunately not much here driving is floaty and feels more akin to the muscle cars of the 1960s granted i am only driving lowtier cars but cars not only handle poorly they are often outright uncomfortable to drive and hardly have any braking power the roads feel awkward to drive on and invisible walls are prevalent in places that the player is obviously not supposed to drive in to the point that player vehicles are physically warped around at willgunplay is mediocre i dont feel particularly strong one way or the other guns feel fine but being shot little feedback i will definitely compliment the weapon handling while some weapon placement on the screen is awkward the animations and sounds are pretty kickass across the board by far the most annoying part of the games combat loop is the hacking i previously covered some issues with it but i think the most fair assessment is instead to simply call it clunky its inconsistent ranging from annoying to overpowered both in regards to enemy and player usage stealth is fairly standard to the point that it almost feels like it borrows elements from every other stealth game hitman body hiding watchdogs style camera puzzles and assassin creedfar cry style stealth takedowns consist of much of the stealth gameplay i dont hold that against it as all of those systems are quite good but it doesnt do anything unique with it thats finemelee combat is all over the place powerful enemies will teleport to the player and spam attacks that do damage even through the block function that the game provides for you while lower enemies will stand still and wait for you to hit them this inconsistency is indeed telegraphed in their levels and within their quests but the underlying melee combat system is clunky enough to put off i wasnt fan of melee in the fallout series so perhaps its just not for in game like thisplayer customization is surfacelevel at best while there are many expanded options for hair teeth and even eyes the complete lack of body sculpting system is incredibly noticeable i dont necessarily need the ability to customize every single individual triangle of my character model but the fact that my only two body options range between having moderatelylarge pair breasts none at all or giving my character genitalia of some kind was greatly offputting moreover choosing the female option noticeably breaks several cutscenes with player hands clipping through objects from an animation standpoint it is clear that they intended for most players to play as male edit i also wanted to add mild addendum that i did not mention initially the games ux is pretty looking but incredibly irritating to work with there are so many junk items in the game and the hud can become incredibly cluttered at some points even menus have this problem with the skill tree being largely indecipherable blob that requires

bear with this wont be short if you want tldr the game is great it some nongamebreaking graphical glitches the story setting and characters are greatfor people who enjoy readingyou have htpc you saywhen this game came out i said that even though i like the setting of the game i wont ever play it the reasons were my pc i5 750 yes first generation core type cpu and gtx1650 very low midrange card and the requirements and state of the game it couldnt run properly even on new hardware at the time one year later i got an email saying the game is in 50 sale before buying the game though i had to look up if my hardware is really that bad or if i could run the game at some decent pace i watched few videos of the game running on gtx1650 and when i discovered it can run 30fps i was hooked i bought cyberpunk 2077slow hdd on 30 fpsand so it began first few hours were benchmarking i had to fiddle with settings lot the biggest impact was when i turned on the slow hdd even though i have ssd mx500 the game runs fine from that point even on medium details game runs 28 to 35 fps for with dips to 20 when cruising busy parts of town at high speed this may be caused by hw but also by playing on linux through protonas you can see im not part of 60 fps gang i care only about smoothness for 30 frames per second are good if they are stable that isnight city and what it offersi started playing the game right away i loved the setting from the start i was quite surprised to learn that first few hours are actually prologue before the big unveiling of the story itself when i finished prologue i really got hooked up the city is big i dont mean there are many streets i mean its big there are so many back alleys and elevators to look into so many people and shops and everything you will be overwhelmedi started doing some quests main story and side quests and even gigs as the small ones are called gigs are like fetchquests from standard fantasy rpgs but every one of them is different from each other yet they are simple they lack depthbackstorycharacterswhat is really great about this game are characters starting with v your character i picked female with big boobs d and started as streetkid as it is what i believe authors of this game meant to be the main role v is really street kid kinda nobody but she knows the tricks and how it works you meet another strong character right away and the game really doesnt stop giving until the end every character i met backstory i liked lot of themmechanicscyberpunk reminds of deus ex in cyberpunk you play as kinda technological wizard you can pick the way you are gon na do the game you have weapon arsenal at your disposal and you can brute force your way through the game i went more stealth and hacky way i really enjoyed playing the game and i will replay it but i will go different way that time male with big dthe weapons armor cyber implants skills and perks you can do so much in this game i cant really write much about it as i havenŧ explored it that muchyou can craft and im telling you specifically because you can craft ammo remember that it saved my ass many timeswitcher 3 vibehow can cyberpunkstyle game have fantasy vibe i doesnt but when you open inventory character info screen when you see dialogue options its straight up copy of witcher 3 in some regards if you played it you will see it lot of it in this game toopoint of returnbefore i realized it i was at point of return in the story that was around 37 hours ingame time i was level 24 at the time with many side quests still being of high or very high danger meaning they are for higher level character i went for the story for the next three hours i couldnt get up from my pc it was so intensei will keep playingafter watching one of the endings i went back into the game straight away and this is why im writing this review right now this game kept my interest after finishing it im not done with night city it still draws in i still want to play the game finish more quests and that is how i recognize good game i want to play it i want to play it more it doesnt become chore i still enjoy it the samedriving more like survivingthe one thing i dont enjoy is driving around in the game my driving on the keyboard is rusty i know but this game seems to make it even worse im not kidding when i say that cyberpunk gave the worst driving experience i ever had on pc i played my first racing game in 1998 it was f1 game of that year i had my share with nfs and test drive games i played gtas cyberpunk is the worst the cars and bikes are unreadable until you hit 100mph but you cant cut citys corners at 100mph when i turn at slow speed the car overturns every single time you try to correct you end up in the opposite way i drove over so many people unintentionally because i couldnt control the car not good especially in the game where you are meant to drive quite bitnote when reviewing before posting i forgot to mention here that i tried driving on gamepad its not better than keyboard i struggled with it the samenight city is offering itself but can you get into itand here we are at the second thing i quite dont undestand this is more thing than the games i have played for 40 hours i did quite lot of quests met lot of characters yet i still dont know my bearings in the night city you want to go to the afterlife club i dont know where it is you want to go to the pacifica district i dont know how to get there you want to simply join the highway circle around the city i would have to get on it by chance in witcher 3 i got to know every settlement every cave cyberpunk doesnt provide the same experience the city is foreign alien to even after spending so much time in it and going through some streets multiple times i dont remember even the names of those few city districts the city is impersonal but the story setting supports it to some degreeminimap badi still know my bearings in gta3 vice city and san andreas up to this day hell i could even navigate oahu in test drive unlimited better than i do night city and we are talking playing without gps i learned the streets and roads of oahu and gta games without the game telling where to turn 15 hours into cyberpunk i turned of minimap that was the point where i started to learn the city bit i still dont know where i am or how to get to the next point but i started to notice landmarks at last i dont enjoy driving without purpose so i wont learn the layout just by living in the city if you are like turn off the minimap it will help you to get to know the city betteron the lighter notewhile the game got patched lot it still some glitches shopkeeper standing on top of other shopkeeper people going through other people on the street cars parked halfway inside other cars npcs turning the steering wheel without moving their hands npcs going through objects none of those are gamebreaking i consider them funny everytime i saw something like that i stopped had look and with smile on my face i went on to my questso here we are end of the review if only i knew what to say heretoo bad it is one year after release that the game finally got to the state in which it should have been at the launch date im still glad i bought it this is not an ordinary game this one will have that special place for it doesnt make it that high as some iconic ones

night city is city of dreams and im big dreamerwake the up samurai we have game to reviewbuckle up dummies were diving into the wonder that is cdprs cyberpunk 2077 i want to start off by saying that ive been looking forward to this game since the e3 2018 trailer dropped with my excitement massively ramping up when the 48minute demo was released after seeing it i knew then and there that id enjoy the game anyways lets dive into this mess of review its bound to be hell of ride the good if you got ta kill kill if you got ta burn it all to the ground then let it burn the gameplay is solid its nothing we havent seen before but it works well enough for what it is the gunplay feels good and the perks are serviceable if somewhat bland statbased perks arent really what im looking for in an rpg but hey i cant really complain the cyberware mods however is where the fun really starts the mantis blades gorilla arms double jumps and charge jump all add up to compelling implant system that makes the game whole lot of fun to explore and enjoythere are lot of things this game does right the main thing that sold on this game apart from cdprs pedigree is the setting for as bad as it might be to live in it the dark future looks highly enticing to personally swapping out your arm for chromeplated cybernetic counterpart getting your nervous system augmented with microprocessor that can straightup rival it hell getting fullbody conversion to become tricked out borg is about as cool as it gets the game makes you asks yourself at what point do we stop being human how much chrome is too much and if youre anything like that really gets the gears in your brain turning pun intendedthe atmosphere is another one of the games strong suits walking the streets of the dark future never felt this immersing youll be able to feel the bleakness of the trashfilled streets of pacifica the gaudiness of the gated communities of westbrooks north oak subdistrict the familiarity of heywoods neighbourhoods and the freedom of openskies of the badlandsthe characters and the story are the games shining stars in my opinion rivalling games such as the last of us and red dead redemption 2 cyberpunks characters are some of the best designed written and acted ive seen yet not once in my 200 hours of playtime did i think to myself these are just pixels on screen because to these were real people this is testament to the writers actors and designers of these characters who have all done stellar job in bringing them to life for us to interact with johnny in particular brings different perspectives and takes to the table that have made reconsider situations that i might not have otherwise his boastful attitude and witty remarks add wonderful flavour to each encounter shows up in which is godsend because if had been anything but that would quickly become unbearable the story plenty of buttclenching serious lighthearted and funny moments as well as heartwrenching and downright disturbing moments in certain characters questline youll know it when you see iti wont talk about the graphics much because personally due to the age of my system i was only able to get playable framerate with lowmedium graphics even so the game looks good if i had rig which could support raytracing and all the bells and whistles it wouldve improved my experience but as it stands now i cant complainthe soundtrack oh lord the soundtrack it is physically impossible for not to sing huehue the praises of this games score and soundtrack speeding down the highway with the radio blasting metal on full volume the cellos of johnnys rebel path theme and the different combat themes of each district all add up to very pleasant auditory experience ive been checking spotify each day since the games release to see if my favourite tracks have been added so i can listen to them whenever im out and about hell im listening to the score as im writing this reviewbut of course it cant be all sunshine and rainbows lets talk about some aspects that arent as savoury the bad test of persons true value death facing it staring it down you cant deny that cdpr failed to deliver on some aspects of the game the cut subway system which was displayed in the games very first trailer as well as promotional images removed features such as the mantis blade wallclimbing being able to sit on benches and such i understand that some sacrifices must be made for the whole game to be better but still dangling carrot in front of our eyes through trailers and gameplay showcases then taking it away on the hushhush isnt cool then theres the deceitful marketing and the whole console while being outraged that 7 year console cant run game that was clearly intended for nextgen systems is incredibly stupid to theres denying that cdpr could have informed customers of the issues that plague the base consoles in order for them to either make more informed decision when it comes to buying the game or cancelling their preorders if they already paidi believe the management and the suits at the very top have over the hardworking devs who have poured their hearts and souls into this game and it really shows its honestly outrageous to see the devs taking flak for decisions they themselves had say in regardless it is what it is the past cant be changed now lets move on the stuff that everyones been laughing about the ugly youre starting to remind of fifty years back minus the charisma and impressive bugs we all know about the bugs by now genitals popping out through clothing npcs acting like absolute tools naked tposing on bikes cars blowing up for reason the whole lot in my experience most of the bugs were simple visual issues that didnt impact my experience much apart from taking out of the moment and at times making laugh my off that being said i encountered few gamebreaking bugs during my 200 hours which frustrated the hell out of thankfully these were kept to minimum dying for reason when falling 3 feet getting permanently stuck after being hit by an npc in car falling on slanted surfaces which would put you in an animation loop that would slowly damage you until you die the performance at launch was quite bad to get through but it massively improved ever since my i54590 and gtx 1070 struggled lot when the game first came out but with patch 106 at the time of this review the performance greatly improved and the game is already in much better state even on comparatively old system like mine i dont doubt for one second that the game will be much more enjoyable after 34 months from release it wont be bugfree sure but it will definitely be in better state than what it was at launch so far in my 200 hours the game only crashed once though your experience may vary depending on your system closing thoughts thing of beauty i know will never fade away it makes sad that not all people have enjoyed this game as much as i have flaws and all sure its nothing spectacular or lifechanging as some people thought this game would be but if you honestly thought this game would blow your mind youre really shooting yourself in the foot in time after vast majority of the bugs have been fixed and all the dlcs have come out i have doubt that this game will be as wellregarded by the people who have played it as the witcher 3 if not more so i for one cant wait for that day to come take care chooms,Recomendado,1,7365,31,Positivo,"['Setting', 'Atmosphere', 'Characters', 'Story', 'Soundtrack']","['Cut features', 'Deceitful marketing', 'Bugs']",No Mencionado,True
spoilers this is going to be long one the minimap doesnt zoom out while driving reintroduced in patch 13 as i finished the game shortly after it first came out i have been holding off reviewing it for whileim not getting into all the bugs etc at all nor the deceitful behavior from cdpr throughout the development and release just the game itself the gameplay and the mechanicsto be clear i was never part of any hype train and only paid attention to what cdpr specifically said the game would be so why that header for its just so telling for the game in general even after they fix it the point still persist its such ultra basic thing for the minimap to zoom out while driving in games like this so you dont have to slow down before every junction in case you might have to turn next but they still got it wrongthats kinda what you can expect feeling lot while playing this gamesaying to yourself huh why does it act like that and not like this it would have been better if it would have made lot more sense ifyou will feel this especially if you have any experience with gta or other games in which do open world city driving etc we will definitely be getting back to that later so whats good about this game even though its really poorly optimized it is visually very impressive it looks amazing stunningi absolutely love the atmosphere the look of the city the open world in general the lore most of the story the battlegun system the great side quests that often more than rivals lot of what the main story have to offer the perk system and the ability to equip cyberware whats wrong with it that list is sadly quite long and mostly subjective of coursefirst off the game been cut to piecesheavily watered down from the original visionmarketingeg day and night cycles the metro weather impacting the game important life path selection it doesnt matter at all crowd community system third person cutscenes the ai etc etcthe ai was supposed to be groundbreaking but instead it is groundbreakingly badit feels so stiff and fake and theres nothing to it at all reactions interactions heart factions you can play into for depth nothingyou will never feel more alone in huge city than you do playing this gamemuch older games did it way better there were supposed to be routines etc for the npcs they were supposed to feel alive and part of the gamethats not at all the casethey can do two things1 cower2 run and despawn right in front of your eyes literallythey dont react to you in any meaningful way at all the cops the ai itself is nonexistent thats mostly true for the cop system as well you never see them or interact with them there are car chases real wanted system you see them from time to time on street corners almost tposingother than that they just always annoy you if you aim your gun in public or hit pedestrian etc and they then almost always will become aggro to you if you did the deed on the top of mountain cop probably saw it somehoweven if you go in guns blazing out of nowhere helping them on crime they ignore you before during and after the factas whole the wanted system should have been cut as its detrimental to the gameplay and immersioni mean they only just recently patched that cops would spawn right behind you matter where you were at the time in the weeds or on top of building the city looks great feels very unreal as ive been saying there is lot to do but it absolutely effect on anything at all it doesnt impact you the game or the ainothing you do will the gigs crimes etc are just random effect happenings plus lootits just you against the virtual world in which you are imprisoned and with that i mean that it feels like you are in virtual world in game the story it was actually good but its very clear how much they have watered down the experience to be able to get it out as fast as possible the prologue with jackie is the closest you get to the next gen rpg feels but the buck stops there after that it just becomes normalaverage currentlast gen not directly bad by any means just really disappointingthe worst thing for with the story is that its finite its closed off either you finish the game or you donti wanted to complete the last mission and then keep playing after the fact somehowgo back and do the stuff i didnt do but you cant you can only go back to before doing the last mission it feels bad after all that work and it shows if you look at how fast people stop playing it on steam alonei wanted to keep playing building my character doing side quests tie up loose ends until new content came out because you know its supposed to be next gen open world rpgits definitely not that visually maybe so whats up with the gta thing just to be clear this is not gta nor should it bebut its still the funniest thing ever it seems like they have gone above and beyond to not being compared to gta im pretty sure it was probably banned to talk about gta in their office during developmentthat would explain lot as to all the things they missed or got wronggta is game with similar city vibes whats wrong with looking at what they are doing right when it comes to open world driving ai city stuff interactions reactions physics and mechanics and then making them even better for this genphysics and mechanics are physics and mechanics most of which will be the same if you want it to feel as real as possibleits not about copying gta or not setting your game clearly apart from it its about looking at how other people have solved the same issues and why gamers like it so much pre crazy town gta of courselike it or not gta is competitor and im pretty sure rockstar was very relieved as to how cyberpunk turned out especially if you think gta 6 and that cdpr wants to take cyberpunk online at some pointin general there are really old rpgs that did many rpg things better some of which isnt even included in this next gen rpg conclusion with all that being said i actually enjoyed playing i mean i have 100 hours in it rightwell its complicatedi held off doing the main story for the first like 90 hours just because i was hoping lot of those bad mechanics etc would get patched improved on etc so the gameplay would be better i wanted to save the main story for that so i spent my time hunting loot grinding etcbut then i couldnt hold on to my naïveté any longer so i started doing the story for real from the first bossin what felt like blink of an eye 510 hours i got that prompt going backthe end to the game the last mission i was shocked all that grinding for nothing it just ends it wants you to stop you have tolike that moronic cdpr moderator said on reddit i believe it was our games have an ending they always have its your problem if you dont like itwell the main story can still end credits and all without it forcing you to stop playing or only being able to go back to before the end buuuut as baffling as the mechanics etc were at times i genuinely enjoyed playing the gamebut in the end that enjoyment was like dragging my bare arse over course carpet like dogit kinda feels good now but you will feel hollow and regretful laterpeople should definitely look into it but maybe hold off for now they are literally still bugfixing to this day stuff like physics gameplay mechanics etc will probably not see any action before good while if everi really hope i can recommend this in future also

tldr great game buried under mountain of bugs and unfinished content id wait for more patches before purchasingi will update this review as more patches go livepros the soundtrack its perfect they completely nail the cyberpunk aesthetic all of the cdpr produced samurai tracks fit so well into the world theyve created i love how they really lean into the punk rock mythos and make it major theme throughout the game the one knock i have is that there just isnt enough tracks to fill out the large amount of radio stations they have in game you end up hearing lot of repeats main storyline campaign side gigs love interests panam and judy are by far the most fleshed out characters in the game besides v and johnny themselves both of their storylines are extremely well written and give you real sense progression from both relationship and character arc perspective they each get 3 or 4 major missions packed with character development i think detective river ward was supposed to be another major love interest but it feels like they cut lot of his story as you only get one major mission with him although that hunt for the serial killer was an excellent mission river just felt like blip compared to panam and judy and thats shameneutral general performance now im saying this as someone who pretty solid rig this game bad optimization if youre running an rtx 3070 or amd equivalent it will run pretty well dlss is massive performance boost but is only available on rtx 20 and 30 series cards the difference between my gtx 1080ti fe and an rtx 3070 was day and night if youre running more dated pc youre going to have to make some concessions to play it at stable 60 fps if youre lucky enough to have an rtx 3080 or 3090 and good cpu game look good combat slinging lead and slicing up enemies with katana feels great they did good job with most of their weapon designs how they sound and the associated combat animations the problem with combat isnt the art side its the programming and design side there is level indicator greenyellowred nameplate to let know what to expect before entering fight the only thing you get is skull if the enemy is much higher level than you if i hit tab to scan people there should be very clear ui element letting know how strong they are compared to i feel like i either wiped the floor with my enemies or they wiped the floor with there was never any middle ground game desperately needs balance pass braindances netrunning the animation and visual effects are excellent this might be one of the coolest parts of the game but what kills is the fact that there is only handful of braindances in the whole game there are tons of npcs that supposedly sell braindances and lot of journal logs talk about plethora of bds you can experience but you cant actual purchase or experience any of it also netrunning was awesome just shame that outside of couple missions there is way to do it 219 support while playing with my 1080ti every time i loaded the game it put black bars on the sides of my screen forcing to go into display settings apply lower resolution and then reapply my native resolution to fix it i did not have this issue while using rtx 3070cons illusion of choice too many of the dialog options throughout the game have real impact on the outcome of any given mission obviously unfinished content you can tell they really cut down some of the open world areas large chunks of the map are completely inaccessible arasaka waterfront like half of pacifica laughably short life paths ai is in shambles i could go on and on bugs you can really tell what parts of the game they did or did not have time to polish the main storyline quests and major side quests are excellent i ran into very few bugs during the scripted missions themselves there are lot of bugs you can attribute to the nonexistent ai more on that later but there are also lot of physics game systems and animation bugs heaped on as well from randomly dying while walking down stairs to naked tposing while riding motorcycle the whole game just needed more time in the oven nonexistent ai outside of specific missions where some npcs or bosses are specifically scripted the ai does pretty much nothing it sounds like they either didnt finish it or disabled it to eek out better performance in the 10 release either way its downright embarrassing for company like cdpr to release game in this state driving feels very finnickysluggish driving just doesnt feel good lack of vehicle customization is very disappointing police wanted system i think this already been memed to death but cops spawning behind you cop car chases barest of bare bones wanted system its very embarrassing from aaa studio game intro life paths this felt like it was extremely low effort basically the game gives you three different origin stories with 30 minute mission each woo beat on the brat storyline after talking with coach near your starting apartment this starts series of wagered mma fight missions these are the most unbalanced unfun missions i might have ever played in game after thirty tries i just gave up and found ways to cheese them you can drop two melee weapon on the ground and press r to equip while the fight is underway it will block the first equip but the second will work and then you can melee weapon double jump your way to victory the beast in storyline after meeting claire in the afterlife youre invited to join series of street racing gigs there is zero racing ai once you get out in front you win its awful player customization the character creator itself was far more shallow than i was hoping for they also need some sort of transmog system or complete overhaul of their armorcrafting system because in order to have statistically good character you have to look like clown most of the time how cyberpunk handles sexual themes and encounters at every turn cyberpunk tries to throw sex in your face with constant barrage of overt sexual ads but when sex can be portrayed in any meaningful way they hold back throughout the game i dont think there is more than 4 heterosexual and 3 homosexual encounters possible as male v none of the encounters i experienced had more than partial nudity one was even fully clothed though im assuming that was bug now im not expecting cdpr to show fullon hardcore sex or anything but for game as sexually saturated as 2077 its also weirdly prudish instead of having genuine discussion about sex workers cdpr just portrays them as the cliché abused underclass which is mindblowing when you have the mox essentially sex workers union turned gang to protect themselves in your game the problem is they talk about the mox for like one mission and then basically act like they dont exist for the rest of the game its just frustrating because you can tell cdpr laid the groundwork for some very interesting stories but instead they just lean back into tired tropes i also have serious problem with the mission in clouds where the game essentially makes your character bisexual this is the infamous angelskye mission in an rpg taking away players sexual agency is bad idea sexual preference should have been in the character creatorcomputer specs intel i9 9900k evga gtx 1080ti fe 64gb ddr4 3200 ram lg 34gk950fb 3440x1440 144hz 500gb samsung 970 evo m2 ssd,No

spoiler free reviewjust above the averagefor the 95 of my first playthrough if youd ask for point grade of cyberpunk i would give it something around 6510 above average mostly thanks to the story visuals and music that are all part of experience with the game sadly numerous bugs glitches and minor issues sabotaged an otherwise strong 9 or even 95 but then after playing through all possible endings the story part kinda fell apart dropping the six and half even lower just kinda cause three endings were rather decent but then again one strips you off of around 90 minutes of gameplay and then kicks you in the face for choosing it while the others are not really satisfying and there are plenty more which are just bad in my opinion and because of that i felt disconnected from the whole story and even the 6510 i was readying in my head turned into 5and with an exactly average game i thought to myself well do i even recommend cyberpunk 2077 to others after few battles with my thoughts i decided yes yes i wouldcyberpunk 2077 is actually good game shame it is so overshadowed by how many bugs it and how the story let down at the very end what lived up to the hypei am actually surprised how wellcrafted the ingame world is it made immersed from the get go and thats easy task everything from giant skyscrapers to the smallest houses in the badlands is top notch there was lot of care taken in creating night city and its outskirts quite honestly it actually works like real city would i know i know i just got surprised by it just think about how many games have cities that could actually be habited and used not just for show its not created with heavy impact on travelling by car sure the roads are important but if you wanted to stroll through the city on foot youd have proper sidewalks crossings aisles and footbridges for your disposal something eg gta v was lackingthe lighting the sounds everything seems in order for 2077 metropolis and it makes sense too led lights and all that cyberstuff wasnt just put left right and center for the sake of it the cybersolutions have strong reason to be there instead of neondiarrhea led lights are only in places needing an actual highlight not wasting too many resources so worldbuilding is top notchand then music music is fantastic i already fell in love with couple of tracks the selection of genres is wide and well fitting soundtrack payday syndrome its more beneficial to go stealth but music is way better when you go loud energy given to you through the eardrums is just something else something i enjoyed the most the storyquite honest with you i was very surprised by how neatly the story is constructed the prologue itself takes around 6 hours to get through thats insane that time is also used to perfection you get to bond with some characters you find reason to progress the story and most importantly you start finding alliances and rivalries the characters are likable relatable and compelling you decide how you want to progress and whose stories you want to focus on and the main protagonist v genuinely had think of himher as myself which is an enormous amount of fun being able to feel as part of the game so the immersion aspect was unexpectedly well executedwhat did not live its obvious that the hypetrain for cyberpunk 2077 was far beyond anything this game could achieve lets be honest here the hype surpassed even the one for halflife 3 and that was not healthy for the games release which was just full of flops bugs issues glitches not even far into the game it took less than 30 minutes for the first gameplaydisrupting glitch to occur thats basic stuff that just shouldnt pass qa you know what that reminded of the witcher 3 cd projekt red just wasnt that big back then and more importantly they didnt have that impossible to achieve level of hype behind them witcher 3 was just as bugged and it was fixed in weeks time following the release just like cyberpunk was supposed to be i think i have idea what was going on the peoples mind while first setting release date when we got that broken of title on 10th of december by the time of writing this review the game been patched 6 times already and lot of early game issues have been addressed but cyberpunk is still far from perfect it can now be finished though because guess what the first iteration of the game couldnt be completed as the final boss was just impossible to kill fun rightthe amount of things that still need polishing is astounding im not sure how much time will the game need to reach the state at which it can be considered fullystable at least the random crashes dont occur so often anymore the save states dont get corrupted anymore either so heres hoping that cyberpunk 2077 will reach point at which bugs and issues will be thing of the pastdriving in this game is absolutely horrendous its disgusting with all vehicles i know im racing genre veteran but this was just unbearable understeer is all over the place cars and bikes steer like bricks halfsunk in the sand and the only working brake is the handbrake and it doesnt work too well either so the fast travel becomes mustthe rpg aspect of the game had bit wondering multiple endings and choices matter were thrown at way before cyberpunks release and you know what the first one is true second not so much yeah the differences between endings are in most cases like day and night but the way you get there is not as varied as you could hope for your dialogue options especially while talking with johnny silverhand could as well be limited to yes progress it hurst to say this but there are multiple situations which just ask for any other outcome you can be snarky complete jerk very independent person or wholesome guy and still the dialogue goes mostly exactly the same for every approach why make characters love or hate i dont care but let choose the way they will respond next dont let them come back to neutral line after i insulted or complimented them thats not how humans work matter how you look at it its step back from witcher 3what is left to talk about is the endingi want to bash someone for it i am damn glad i took my time before finishing the game cause the endings are just so disappointing almost regardless of which route you choose feels like the writers responsible for how cyberpunk comes to an end were different people than those who designed the rest of the game i have felt so disconnected from everything i have learned about the game and characters portrayed in it that it almost ruined the entire experience for in most endings most because as i said earlier on i can accept three of them accept is not high praisemost of the endings are just illogical weird stupid even and the results of picking those endings just disappointmentin the end i spent lot of time weighing whether or not would i recommend this game to anyone and you know what despite well everything i would i really would with patches coming every other week maybe in some time the game will reach better state but you know what even with those bugs glitches and all the issues you might come across its very lengthy and very fun experience just maybe enjoy your time before reaching the point of return because after that it gets messy,Recomendado,1,7253,34,Positivo,"['Historia', 'Visuales', 'Música', 'Mundo del

if youre looking for more quality reviews like this follow our curator page devils in the detailthe night city of reality the night city of expectationscyberpunk 2077 is game of grandiose ideals that came with grandiose marketing to the extent that it can be chore parsing out the games fluff from its actual content the ad campaign that surrounded the project was so invasive and ubiquitous that even after almost 60 hours of playtime im still not fully equipped to separate what the game is from what it was intended or advertised to be thats not wholly cd project reds fault either i ultimately bear some responsibility for creating something in my mind that developer ever fully realized part of that to do with the high esteem that i hold for their previous projects specifically the witcher 3 so its not completely fair to cd project reds creative and yet it was also their marketing that constructed the hype train i was riding regardless of how we got here the sheer amount of dissonance from what i thought i would play partly my fault from what the game actually became mostly their fault creates tricky ruleset for reviewing aside from the game figuratively crashing headlong into the hurdle of my expectations the game is still sometimes fun its usually charming occasionally dull always buggy relatively beautiful mess of game the exhausting vacillation between positive attributes and negative characteristics makes for rather arduous game of mental tennis few parts of the game come without greatness likewise part comes without lethargy the incongruity between the positive and negative makes reviewer somewhat hesitant to state the game is good or bad or fair but i will with lump in my throat saythe game is ok and when it was over i was ready to move onhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2337786881 mistakes were madetheres an rpg problem that exists and its pervasive in two waysfirstly the character you control v is already paintbynumbers character for whom the player will fill in the canvas ive seen this criticized in general sense and im not completely on board thousands of rpgs like this have already existed without complaint geralt from the witcher works in similar fashion you never take the reins of characterization completely this is different aside from book series and three video games worth of establishment from what came before other than it seemingly contrasting from what was advertised but make mistake v is already person and people have problems goals and aspirations you will not decide these for her or in my case him occasionally though there are general inconsistencies with v it seems weird for instance that streetkid would work with police officers and politicians yet does if you allow him to so should i simply not allow it or is it mistake for the developers to have allowed it the onus is ambiguous the answer unfortunately appears to be of consequence v can or cant you decide any streetkid code in your head is just that in your head which makes the roleplaying feel superfluoussecondly the main quest of cyberpunk 2077 is timesensitive not actually but storywise this is an enormous issue it creates story template that conflicts with the players desire to explore if the main quest deadline and that deadline not being met results in something terrible happening why in the world would v if this were real bother doing anything else that cd project red went through the trouble of creating the answer is that v would not because it doesnt make sensehow can cyberpunk 2077 justify that anyone with even slight measure of intelligence particularly its protagonist would go through the trouble of falling in love racing cars beating up nobodys having sex eating drinking or shopping if they had this totally separate issue that renders all of these earthly pleasures utterly meaningless the main story breaks the world httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2337770249 the player simply can not based on the games own story rationalize doing anything other than the main quest and that main quest isnt that long especially in comparison to the amount of side content and because the plot moves so quickly and v so slowly disconnect forms and the plot cant sustain itself you see its possible that v the player will be just too busy messing with hookers or dirt biking in the desert or getting drunk in bar to adhere to the allimportant details of the quest cyberpunk 2077 says is the most important its easy to outroleplay the narrative because any main plot particularly one that is timesensitive simply dissolves in an open world like this basically why give the player tons to do then by the nature of the plot tell them theres time to do any of it because as stated if this were real they surely wouldnt v looks like an idiot for having fun the land of zero gravitydespite the lack of sense it makes for character who should be doing anything but there are lots of fun things to do in night city i was regularly captivated by the vistas the populace the pulsing radio and the night jaunts through the citys underbelly while not being revolutionary i felt this much and more in the fantasy realms within the witcher 3 it still achieved high level of verisimilitude for the city proper theres something to night city even if it was less than advertised many of my favorite moments of the game were the straightaways with my figurative foot on the gas speeding into oblivion it was in these moments when night city felt alivefor few seconds at least until i would suddenly glitch outside my car and be suspended in the air just above it surfing on the hoodbugs and glitches are prevalent i casually surfed on top of my car often you will see anomalies like this everywhere and the real tragedy with these regular irregularities other than their predictability is that they ruin moments that would otherwise work exceptionally well imagine sensitive moment between two lovers or friends or glorious shootout where v against all odds blasts his way through legion of adversaries only to be met with invisible goons random floating objects or decapitated people who are still very much alive despite its potential for danger bugs colored the whole of night city in something goofy and unintimidating its circus clownhouse night city is supposed to be as much of character as v is and either by content or unintentional moments of motosurfing complete with floating inanimate objects or people that goal is never fully realized and that is the biggest shame of cyberpunk 2077httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2337775537 conclusioncyberpunk 2077 does not feel especially innovative or finished which is shocking considering its marketing truthfully it just kind of exists another contemporary neither truly offending nor pleasing owning nothing it really excels at or really even anything its particularly poor at save quality controlits pretty glitchy rpgshooter that exists in an open world it grants the player the freedom of exploration and the freedom to level up via skill tree youll meet some interesting characters do some interesting things and in the end spend 50 hours completing it allsound familiar it should youve been playing it for years610

producto recibido forma gratuita its now five years since skyrim first took over everyones lives with players happily spending hundreds of hours exploring what is one of the finest open world environments ever created the fifth mainline entry in the elder scrolls series creator bethesda warned that there will not be sixth for some considerable time yet and so instead theres this special edition so named because ordinary remaster doesnt sound quite so appealingin terms of content this is exactly the same game as was released in 2011 albeit with all the subsequent dlc included from the start it seen graphical upgrade though the details of which well get into in moment there is also mod support available from launch which on the playstation 4 in particular been long time comingalthough its taken for granted nowadays the transition of the elder scrolls from niche franchise to mainstream hit was great surprise at the time before 2006s oblivion the idea of western roleplaying game being one of the most successful games of the year wouldve been laughed at and yet its popularity paved the way not just for skyrim but the mainstream acceptance of the likes of dragon age and the witcherthe elder scrolls success is doubly surprising given the rather bland tolkienesque fantasy world the games are set in although its lack of distinguishing features made it easier for bethesda to create more grounded experience for skyrim that doubt helped to attract more casual interest each game is named after particular location in the world with skyrim being nordicinspired land of horned warriors and snowy mountainsas the game starts your character who can be customised from any number of humanoid races been mistakenly rounded up with bunch of prisoners rebelling against the games continentspanning empire youre later able to join either side if you wish but the rights and wrongs of the situation are not at all clear cut your initial consideration though is that youre about to be beheaded and are only saved by ruddy great dragon attacking the village youve been brought toit transpires that dragons havent existed in the world for centuries and their appearance is supposed to augur the apocalypse naturally you turn out to be the chosen one that can stop them dragonborn who is able to learn their language and absorb their powerthis is all very exciting at the time but once you escape from the dragon the real appeal of skyrim is made clear youre given some advice that you should head to nearby village for help but if you dont want to theres nothing at all stopping you from ignoring the story for the rest of the game and just heading off to explore on your own you can become mercenary learn craft or buy house and find spouse its entirely up to you and the game encourages any and every eventualityit doesnt entirely abandon you though and if it thinks youve got lost itll start pointing you in the direction of story quest locations although give theres over 200 dungeons to explore the chances of you not happening across something on your own are remotealthough there is third person option the first person view is the default which means the basics of combat are kept as simple as possible the left trigger controls whatevers in your left hand the right whatevers in your right there are few context sensitive actions depending on what they are spells needed to be powered up while theres basic block and counter system for shields but it means you can instantly get stuck in whether youre wielding twohanded battleaxe or fireball and healing spellsgiven the detailed upgrade system and your ability to craft your own weapons armour and potions this is true roleplayer in way youd never expect of such mass market game but bethesda game studios main weakness continues to be dialogue and character interaction the amateur hour voiceovers which range from nordic brogue to californian twang are constantly distracting although the dialogue they mangle is so full of cliché its not as if theyre ruining anythingand despite the move to the playstation 4 the games human characters still look like woodcarved puppets with robotic animation that would often shame playstation 2 game the visuals for the games landscapes are more impressive though especially as you know everything you see from the highest snowcapped mountain to the low marshland is real location that can be travelled to and exploredin terms of improvements for the special edition the frame rate is locked at 30 frames per second with 1080p resolution the draw distance noticeably extended in terms of adding in extra background details like foliage and theres new depth of field effects shadows look more realistic and so too does snow ice and running water theres also lot of use of the god rays that so often ground fallout 4s far harbor dlc to halt although theyre much less problematic here in fact the performance is all round very good with almost slowdown and relatively few bugsparticularly compared to the original playstation 3 release the difference is night and day and yet the special edition is still only emulating the original pc version with maxed out graphics that means its still well behind the pace of modern games especially when compared to conceptually similar titles like the witcher 3 its still the terrible animation and unnaturally static landscapes that you notice before any of the improvements as welcome and as wellimplemented as they are but to do any more wouldve involved remaking the game almost from scratch and wed much rather bethesda work on new game than spend too much time on an old oneafter all its not just the visuals that are showing their age but also the simplistic quest design and narrative structure and yet in way the special edition does have an answer for that in terms of the playercreated mods although theres only very small number so far for the playstation 4 and none of them do anything very interesting beyond adding few new spells or other even more trivial extras but hopefully replacing the dragons with thomas the tank engine will come in timeits been fun to return to skyrim and bethesda have clearly put lot of effort into this special edition even if it is almost as if theyre fighting losing battle with new content though weve desire to play all 100 hours all over again even if were sure many will although of course if youve never played the game at all then this represents incredibly good value for money but for us the main thing we took away from skyrim special edition is how much were looking forward to the next elder scrollsreviewed on playstation 4 xbox 1 and pcin short one of the best western style roleplayers ever made works better than it ever before on consoles but theres only so much new coat of paint can do to hide its agepros enormous game world thats absolutely bursting with side quests secrets and almost infinite choice improved graphics and performance plus all the original dlc and modscons the graphical changes are welcome but the game still shows its age particularly in terms of animation amateurish voiceacting and

controversy the gamefor some people who had actively anticipated cyberpunk 2077 ever since its announcement closely watched every trailer and got themselves hyped up beyond belief the game turned out to be very disappointing luckily im convinced at least i didnt look forward to the game much at all and the only real appeal i saw was the collaboration with one of my current favorite musicians grimes who produced song for the ingame radio and voiced one of the sidequest characters other than that i really couldnt care less about this game but bought into the hype week or so prior to its release and partially transferred my wealth anyway and here we arewithout any further ado im just going to say that few games ever made so invested in them to make it little more bearable to read through ill divide my thoughts into three different paragraphsthe good 1 the designs they are absolutely stunning here from main characters to someone youll only hear few lines from throughout the game from dangerous and scary adam smasher to soothing and routine judy applies to the ingame street ads everything ever so slightly related to the samurai band later about that and clothing for the most part stellar 2 the graphics alright im guilty this very game kinda made upgrade my gpu sooner than i wanted to naturally do so its mind boggling with rtx on ive never seen any other game look prettier the sights you see while driving through the city at night are worth lot by itself 3 the characters each and every from the main character cast is very memorable and well written whenever johnny and yes the trope with the iconic character that only the protagonist can see due to said characters being inside their head is as old as the world examples arkham knight tales from the borderlands appears and starts talking about his terrorist past or just says something disturbing in general you cant help yourself but feel like hes all for real hes just that much of an idealist and you grow to love him for that at least thats the case with you either love johnny to bits or hate his guts inbetween from what ive heard but even the secondary characters like takemura and rogue are to be remembered and have countless things and unique character features to cherish them for 4 side missions just as rich if not even richer as the main story campaign while some of them are lackluster and unapologetically short quest lines such as dream on and the story of convicted murderer wanting to make difference through his newly acquired faith are going to stay with you for long long time all of the secondary quests related to samurai and silverhands past are also win the bickering between the former band members feels like those are the conflicts that couldve easily happened between any of the days of glory longtime passed rock bands be it say metallica or deep purple really authentic 5 the story yes as simple as that i really liked the main story of the game and the way it was flowing full of memorable encounters and events its the meat of the game and keeps you invested throughout written beautifully 6 the symbolism if you as silly as it sounds question yourself what makes human different from god wonder about afterlife and are curious about when does ones life truly end thats the right game to feast on the themes of faith yes faith not religion please never ever mix them together are touched very authentically in one of the sidequests too 7 audio and music the original soundtrack is perfect fit for this world from the menacing and grim v and consumer cathedral to the banging midtempo roller of the rebel path radio music is also great curated by the likes of run the jewels nina kraviz and grimes the latter contributed an absolutely stunning delicate weapon exclusively for the game too easily my favorite from all of the originals from cyberpunk 2077 the meh 1 gameplay yes as sad as it is the game gets little boring to play after while which is cardinal for game like this vehicles feel just okay the gunplay is borderline alright and the quickhack system is fun for while until you realize it was done better even in the first watch_dogs game only the story and the characters kept interested in immersing myself in more of the repetitiveness 2 customization yes sure you can customize your character to oblivion but thats about it you cant even change their haircut later on the clothing system is revolving purely around the stats and will force you to wear things you dislike for that sweetsweet combat advantage cars cant be customized whatsoever but luckily i never really cared about them in the first place but i have to admit that the game really allowed to shape and make my character exactly the way i want them to be even though if you cant be nonbinary in 2077 which i assume you cant since everyone keeps referring to you as to or she exclusively and the game doesnt really give you third option cdpr are completely missing some really important attributes of the cyberpunk genre as whole 3 cyberware oh they advertised it as the pinnacle of videogame customization but more often than not its just another way to improve your stats with visible changes only few of the implants actually change you in drastic way but what about cyberpsychosis you might ask obviously you cant go insane because of all of the chrome in your body like you can in the pennpaper rpg thatd be way too deep for triple 2020 game right 4 consequences of your actions they are kinda there some of the things you do early on

this game is an ambitious game and is brilliant in many respects it deserves positive review yet it is one that i can not give myself remember that all of what i say are and only my own opinion feel free to disagreein terms of combat elden ring added posture break from bloodborne this feature innately encourages you to be on the offensive in order to benefit from it however the bosses in elden ring are some of the most aggressive bosses that have ever graced the soulsborne series they often leave very little window for you to take advantage of especially if you use strengthbased slow weapon you might need to keep dodging the bosss flurries of attacks before you get to poke it once with your ultra greatsword before going back to dodging again this is in direct contrast with the posture system because you are encouraged to be aggressive yet you often cant this led to some players opting to grind out as many levels as they could before fighting boss so that they can simply trade hits with it and win with their raw stats in my opinion this is horrible combat design many bosses have animations that are specifically designed to trick you into dodging early which i do not mind in itself but it does get tiresome when every single boss and their mother starts to do itanother thing to note is that bosses will longer follow through any predetermined combos what i mean is that boss may terminate their combo once they detect you have gotten too far away for them to hit so instead of finishing their combo they would simply stop and reset this further reduces the windows of opportunity that players have to get some damage in the difference between what the player can do versus what the enemies can do in my opinion again have exceeded what constitutes as fair but challenging you are again encouraged to wear heavy armour with high poise so you can just trade hits with bossesspeaking of bosses it seems to that they reuse boss enemies little too often take for instance the godskin duo you get to fight the skinny one you get the fight the fat one you get to fight the spirit version of the skinny one you get to fight the spirit version of the skinny one and then the spirit version of the fat one you get to fight the skinny one along with the fat one you probably end up fighting the godskins over or close to 10 times throughout the gamei know that this is not your traditional action games like the dmc series or nioh but i think the combat system of the soulsborne series deserves better revamp than just adding in the ability to jump however the innate flaw of the combat system alone is not what made wanting to give it bad review i think one can still argue that the essence of soulsborne game lies within the clunky gameplay the buggy camera is part of the challenge as some have arguedwhat truly made not wanting to leave positive review is on the technical side the game advertises coop play with friends yet it still uses the exact same clunky summon system from previous games during coop you lose your ability to ride your horse which was one of the more heavily advertised features of the game mind you and had to travel through the vast open world on foot want to travel to somewhere that one of your friends still havent explored you got ta run there with them sometimes you encounter fog walls on the edge of zones that you have to dismiss all your summoned friends before you may cross it and you have to resummon your friends again just inches away from where they left you just so you may cross that fog wall why man justwhy this alone is not bad enough to discourage coop play the server horrible connection issues i would be sitting right next to my partner as she tries to summon and disconnecting from her world completely randomly or at least as it appears to this paired with the need to constantly summon and resummon gets tedious very quickly once you finally get it working and you are playing with your friends other players get to invade you i know that this is feature that been presence for forever in the soulsborne series but i serious believe that the game is better off without it passive play as it always been is the king in any form of pvp in the soulsborne series the world of elden ring is tough so venturing into difficult enemies npcs with hostile player keep on spamming weapon art that takes away 23 of your hp is nothing but frustrating so the host and their summons would just stay near to the bonfire or grace in this game and not progress the level the invader being constantly outnumbered is also encouraged to hide behind enemies so that they have better winning chance this leads to the absurd sometimes hilarious situations where one does anything once an invasion happens both parties are waiting for the other side to lose their patience first once players actually happen to fight each other lag determines huge portion of the outcome i have turned off crossregion play and yet i could still hit someone 5 times and not see any effects only to have them die seemingly from nothing few seconds later the pvp in this game is very much broken and i believe removing this aspect completely would be overall beneficialanother huge point of frustration for about elden ring is the huge input lag and action queue window the soulsborne series run on the same fairly dated engine and its problems are more obvious than ever the enemies in this game moves fast very fast you need to time your dodge timer well even though you have about 05 seconds of iframes because the moment you press your dodge button is not when your character dodges the seemingly minor input lag is very noticeable and it screws up your timing just enough for you to fail your dodge did i mention about the bad pc optimization when your framerate drops it sometimes makes you unable to control your character and you would die to the most obvious attacks because you can not input command to dodge this leads to action queue which is perhaps my biggest gripe this game queues your actions for instance you can initiate command to dodge but get hit by an attack perhaps because you dodged too late and the game queues that dodge command so that is acted upon as soon as your character becomes free this leads to the absurd situation where you get hit by an attack and your character dodges automatically after being hit often at the wrong time without any additional input from you and dies because you dodged again at bad time all this because you were fraction of second too late on your initial dodge this seems to can not be intentional even though action queue been presence in all the previous games it is by far most noticeable in elden ring other soulsborne games come anywhere closei have ranted long enough and if you somehow made it through my entire post thank you for reading the review of nobody again i want to say that this game is absolutely fantastic in the aspects that it does well in the reason i am leaving negative review is because it could have been so much more again thank you for reading go buy elden ring,No recomendado,0,7071,41,Negativo,[],"['Combate con diseño cuestionable',

yes you mustve heard and seen various of visual bugs and glitches and hard bugs that prevent quest completion so ill try not to talk about that and focus more on the actual gameplay and why you shouldnt waste your time and money on this game but let first briefly confirm that yes these bugs are atrocious absolutely immersion breaking i mean in the supposed year 2077 when i call my vehicle this autonomous smart machine comes and run over if i dont move out the way wtf i guess id be lucky if it doesnt spawn on top of other vehicle and explode or pass by without stopping or spawn but stop 5 full screens away from so i have to run to it or if it somehow not manage to do any of mentioned above i promise you it will spawn the exact opposite direction youre trying to go so you have to do u turn but i digress1 this game lies to you it gives you impression that its open world but its not the outer edges of map contain next to nothing and texture gets noticeably worse as u get farther out and eventually teleports you back into playable part of map many stores and buildings that have doors are locked ones that are open are actually tied to main quest or side questgigs so its not an open map but big closed map 90 side quests are basically extended fetch quests or playing messenger nothing intuitive or interesting you have to drive some npcs here and there but its nothing to drool over theres nothing to do in the overworld its filled with useless empty npcs who runs away screaming if you jump near themb your choices dont really matter it barely matters which lifepath you choose you only play 1 hour worth in the beginning for each lifepath and rest is the same except for some dialogue options but even that doesnt matter because theres only one real dialogue options most of the time game likes to give you impression that youre building out your own story but you are stuck in narrow tracks of predetermined drama its cool but its not what was promised or advertised you can choose whichever dialogue options its the same outcome now some quests are pick or b and if you pick one other disappears but that too doesnt really matter because what matters is what you pick for the last main quest this game was advertised as being able to beat by only playing side quests thats lie you cant there are 5 side questlines but to get to ending credits you have to do the main quest now that wouldnt have bothered if it wasnt advertised as such you cant kill any of the quest npcs theres interesting way to complete the quests other than the one way it was meant to be completed boooorrrrrinnng why not let fail the quest by killing the npc why not let kill children in the game and balance that by having some ultra negative buff that doesnt go away or expensive to get rid of why not let make these terrible choices and deal with it you dont have any freedom in this rpg2 dumb mechanics one of most common sidequestgig is go there kill them but killing them all does not complete the quest in order to complete you must find and open the item called shards in this game which is basically scroll that contains wall of text text which you wont give two crap about it provides lore just boring same generic text and if you dont read it or dont find itor cant because game didnt spawn it most annoying bug then the quest remains uncompleted even though that quest location longer contains any enemies you were supposed to eliminate soooo dumbb if you played witcher 3 then you know about the useless mechanic of crafting which you barely touched well in cyberpunk the dumb mechanic that one sane actually cared or wanted is back with vengeance now if you want to craft good stuff you have to invest your level50 is max but in most play through youd get to 2040 and skill points i mean i have to take level points and skillpoints on being able to craft rare and legendary etc wtf this design choice only make sense if this was some mmo rpg where you can sell your crafted stuff to other players but thats not the case in this singleplayer if you level up crafting your weapon proficiency will be dogcrap but hey you can always respec skillpoints with cheap price of only 100000 _ really and you cant respect levelpoints so gl with thatc lets talk skills theyre the most generic unfun set of skills ive seen in rpg game most of them are just percentage gains1 or 10 etc of base stats like hp or dmg while wielding different weapon types thats it you cant do any unique fun builds your only choice is go for dmg and hp or be useless craftsman playing this game taught something though next time im thinking about buying game first check out the skill tree itd be good indicator of how fun or boring your character will be to play ive learned valuable lessond items are bland 99 items dont do anything interesting only thing youre looking for is dps just take the higher dmg and move on there wont be any cool interaction with skills and items other than percentage boost in proficiency in that said weapon or item i dont care for legendary item that does nothing cool or exceptional and is lower dmg or armor than my uncommon item why would i ever use that and be careful im not sure if this is intended but you cant remove modifications on weapons once you slot them babies in there they are in there for good you can replace with another mods but that destroys previous mod but that mod is only increase anyway soe hope you enjoy elevator rides because theres ââââ ton of them in this game once i got to top floor of building via elevator but i wanted to skip the long elevator sequence so i tried to jump downnot falling far enough for fall dmg until you get to point where it instakills you for being out of bounds again not open worldf the teleporting cops if you commit crime in this game police will spawn behind you like some teleporting mage it doesnt matter if youre out in the open public area or secluded hallways of abandoned apartment you can count on cops to know the exact moment you commit crime and come try to kill you even though when gang npcs are shooting at each other and nothing is happening you the main character is always on big brother watch this cop mechanic seems like such afterthought implementation my disappointment level is over 9000 oh and dont try to get close to them they instaaggro you and try to kill you for even approaching whatg stealth ai is stupid af yup stealth is so arbitrary like how do you not see right next to you but you still use it anyway cuz it gives extra dmg derph terrible ai you punch civilian and they all disappear out of thin air enemies just stand there and watch you kill his buddy coupled this with bad stealth you have yourself some pathetically amusing fights but its more pathetic than amusing though feelsbadmantldrskyrim which was masterpiece by all means came out 9 years ago did everything better than cyberpunkdont play this game it will not be worth it if youre

whether you want to be vigilante pig killer or you just want to drive your motor around and using walking civilians as ramp night city it alli am writing this review on november 22nd 2021 after the 131 patchthis game didnt have good start did it but for the biggest part its all fixed now there are still some bugs but in most cases they are just visualto be honest they are quite ridiculously funny imagine driving alongside character and then you witness the character start spinning to 360 degrees its limbs around like it was possessed by some demonin way cp2077 became family for you know you somewhat hate some of your relatives but you still love them in another way right well thats cp2077 for mewhat do we know cp2077 is just too ahead of its time in the future when we will have implants real life the entire world will be buggy and glitchy this game is just immersiveit took some few good hours to learn to love the game and i would say i am very happy i didnt give up on itfor the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the badas i said above as far as bugs go its pretty stable and i didnt really encounter anything that was majorobviously people are different so this is purely my opinion but i dont like how the car driving feels in this game it feels too stiff and unnatural it might be just because i am used to oldschool car driving lets say gta 3nfs anything before nfs 5 porsche driving bike on the other hand is amazing its what i use most of the times another thing that is somewhat annoying the waypointing system is somewhat bad the routes you get arent the most efficient ones and often your objective isnt appearing on the floor it really is so you end up searching for something and then realize it might be in some hidden basement or something the ui seems to be bit cluttered and confusing and it takes bit to get used to or maybe i am just getting old but i feel like theres point in overcomplicating things the overall mechanics or however you want to call them feel somewhat mediocre but its fine by the game compensates with other stuff you can not edit your facialbody featurestattoos once you press that button thats how youll be stuck for life one more thing and this probably was my biggest oof about the game was that the assault rifles are pretty awfulpistols good revolvers great sniper rifles and melee weapons amazing but the assault rifles are just bad and inefficient even shotguns are decent but what about the good partswhile this section might have less of these bulletpoints theyre the pillar of this game the ultimate moneyshotthe world is so big you will feel like frog in the ural mountains you will feel so smallits quite an interesting feeling that i could never get from any game before for this thing made the game so much more immersiveits beautiful game with purely astonishing views amazing world details and such but the size of it all too so many streets alleys not to mention if you go climbing like goat on all the buildings in my opinion if youre into walking simulators this alone could be worth your eddies ie moneythe story is more than decent it avoids some of the most boring cliches although its not anything mindblowingfriendships and relationships come and go in odd ways depending on how you make your decisions i think its pretty rare to actually feel like your decisions really affect people in games to feel like youre actually influence someone realoften when i had to make decisions i was encountering dillemas such as hm cmon this dude is decent fella i shouldnt be to him and well i usually dont overthink that kind of stuff in game lolthe game is modders paradise if youre into that the internet is full of tutorials and content they arent very finicky to install however updates usually tend to mess with themdid i mention side gigs theres plenty of them but also random events happening around as you walk such as groups of gang members commiting dumb stuff obviously you can go past them but would you after this game will suck you in you wont be able to stop sinking hours in itwhile were on this subject my advice would be to not rush into the story i kinda did and i am not very happy about it and enjoy some of these side stuff first besides leveling up and getting cool stuff which will aid you in the main missions later its also the best way to get to know the gametheres so many references and easter eggs some subtle some not so subtle especially if youre from eastern europeyou can play the game any way you want you can go the boring route nonlethal and stealthy or you can go in guns blazing and not leave one single cell in an enemys body alive of course combination between all of these options is also possibility but i like to keep it simplei do wish it was more fun to play in stealth while i usually am not the stealthy kind of gamer i can and do appreciate game with good stealth cp2077 doesnt have good nor bad stealth its just average i guesswith this i mean purely by how it feels for to play it in stealth you do get to be very creative in stealth you have interesting ways to mess with the enemies and distract them but the satisfaction just isnt there for meultimately its game that will suck you in you will have fun for hours the world is purely amazing youll feel like woah all the time closing notes and random useless blabberingi initially bought this game on preorder i was angry about the delays before i got the chance to play it at the release my pc died now after 1 year i finally get to play it i know its better that i didnt play it at launch but its about the principlei am happy with my purchase and for the price i paid one night out in the city i might have an alcohol problem though i had and still have lot of fun even if i already saw 2 endings i am not letting my grip of it i dont even remember when i was so caught in game that i played it without break until the sun was risingprobably i will go for full completion 60h in this game passed so fast and theres still plenty of juice in this babyas far as the developers go i know they got lot of poo thrown at them but theyre people and they make mistakes and they werent lazy i would say things went wrong because of the team leadingresource management but thats another subject and quite irrelevant point is their hearts are in the right place and they fixed majority of issues and they still are working on the gamemaybe i am being too soft about the situation but it is what it is i cant say i am not disappointed because its not how i expected the game to be after how it was marketed prerelease but i also like to believe i have some common sense and ability to make the best out of situationseditafter putting around 150h in this game i must say there were few more bugs i encountered but nothing major except i once fell through the map and the game reloaded from the last checkpointv stands for vendetta for vigilantism for

here it is ladies and gentlemen our 8 years long waiting is over cyberpunk 2077 is finally here and it turned out to be disappoint pretty big one too well if youre console player you can actually call it full scale disaster thanks to completely broken ports which at the moment i write this were even pulled from ps store but console ports are different story here and now i want to talk about pc version and pc version alone just because you know steam reviews have character limit so yeah matter what you do do not pay for console version but here in steam ill share my thoughts on pc releaselike i said this game is big disappoint for years weve followed cd projekts updates and dreamed about perfect cyberpunk experience and what did we get in the end well pretty much nothing really the funniest thing about cyberpunk 2077 is that theres close to gameplay in it simple like that if youve expected an rpg experience you should forget about it long before starting with this game it is not an rpg not that cd projekt promised us an rpg feel free to check the official description in steam the game is advertised as open world actionadventure but still quite lot of people expected cyberpunk take on good ol witcher 3 while this game it is not witcher long story short its firstperson shooter with cars that takes place in an open world environment and is mixed with chooseyourownadventurelike elements thats pretty much itnot like the formula is big problem by itself quite the opposite i found it quite nice i mean why bloody not right everybody loved deus ex series why not to give us an actionpacked version of it in proper open world environment i mean technically mankind divided was an open world game too but lets just face it the open world there was just gimmick so actionoriented deus ex with proper open world sounds good to and even though huge cyberpunk rpg still sounds like beautiful dream its not like we didnt have any choices in deus ex while this game adds to the formula by including as many of such choices as possible so whats wrong here why all the disappointment let explainfirst for 314000000 game its laughably rough and unpolished the action parts feel like cheap secondgrade fps while driving sigh yeah about bloody driving lets just say you wont be able to use cars in the city without suffering outside the city problem feel free to have fun with your wheels there because theres nobody there but in the city itself its better to either walk or use the quick travel why because you touch anything you instantly get wanted status which means that suddenly therell be an army of cops shooting at you and since its yet another one of those games in which ai is suicidal maniac and pretty much everybody would try to jump in front of your car like i said cars city nobut even that isnt the biggest problem weve seen rough weve survived the bloody stalker sure we can deal with cyberpunk the real problem is there isnt much to do here like at all you either do quests or well thats pretty much it sure there are optional activities here but all of them are the same exact thing simple like that you enter the zone and either kill somebody or access the computer for the experience repeat until out of patience thats it nothing else here even proper collectibles well aside from deck of tarot cards but those hardly feel like the real deal not like i miss all that collectible disaster from the assassins creed series but honestly night city is so empty that youll want to cry remember how many stuff gta series had well forget about that here you cant even change your appearance youre done choosing your genitals which is thing now at the beginning thats it barber shops tattoo salons even though there is way to apply couple of tattoos as some sort of reward gang wars you cant even join faction properly nothing night city is just that bunch of story missions end of the story should i say that it sucks i mean seriously 314000000 for pretty basic chooseyourownadventure experience how why i smell some serious bull here i really wonder if adam kiciński and randy pitchford are friend now because thats how it feels here seriously what did they do with all the money i mean aside from paying keanuthats where things starting to feel good though because story in this game its bloody masterpiece and even though usually im john carmack kind of guy who believes that story in games isnt really that important i totally had blast with cyberpunk unlike witcher 3 character here dont waste your time talking about nothing sure theyll still talk quite lot but the writing here is so rich and full of details that it feels awesome i didnt feel so personally involved with the characters since detroit become human when you play cyberpunk its just impossible not to care and since matter what youll do there wont be perfect ending for everybody the impact is even bigger like detroit cyberpunk makes you think about it for quite some time after you finish it which will take up to 100 hours but only if youre up for 100 completion with all the achievements if all you want is main storyline itll be like 50 hourstrust though youll want to do optional quests i mean quests not those crappy activities the optional quests here theyre at least as good as the main story some of them are even better actually so nicely written so full of details so perfectly directed awesome stuff its just those dont really feel like optional stuff especially since theyre directly connected to the choices youll have at the end in other words optional quests are not really optional awesome but not optionalunfortunately like i said aside from those quests night city cant offer you anything literally anything aside from unpolished fps sequences open world here its gimmick proper rpg experience proper exploration proper activities like i said this game nothing only some shooting and some basic chooseyourownadventurelike choices thats it thats the entire game unlike many others i didnt experience single major bug during my playthrough was playing since the moment the game was launched and man does it look breathtaking even though the optimization is horrible the game comes with some brilliant textures fantastic hdr and beautiful ray tracing but lets just admit it eight years 314000000 keanu reeves something this basic is not what we all expectedso i dont know i dont want to give this game thumb down just because personally well i loved it here said it even though i dont have tendency to treat video game characters like real people the characters in cyberpunk 2077 became like family to the writing in cyberpunk is that awesome and i sure treasure my memories here but when its about gameplay cyberpunk 2077 is rough shallow empty and overall disappointing game remember the first xenus aka boiling point road to hell add godlike writing and thatll be it so at the end of the day i have only one question what did they do with the bloody money,Recomendado,1,6963,44,Negativo,['Historia'],"['Gráficos', 'Jugabilidad', 'Contenido']",No Mencionado,False
let just start by saying that if you like this game youve won the argument by virtue of enjoying something im struggling to if youre having fun thats great if youre besotted with the world thats fair and youre not wrong nothing in this review is intended to piss off the hive i just have to write about the impressions i honestly feelcyberpunk 2077 is game that is unforgivably marred by one thing and one thing only overpromotion thesis could be written on how audacious cyberpunks marketing been the hype train is of course not all cdprs fault but the false promises are releasing too early and expecting you to pay 50 for the privilege of being an unofficial beta tester is look i work in marketing so i know how it goes but when you promise so much and know you cant deliver on it and change

stay consistentlet make this clear i was not on the hype train for this game hype makes feel nervous and i try to deaden myself to it im also realistic i understood that it takes more for game to be developed in the currentgen to offer truly nextgeneration experience and found it miracle that red dead redemption 2 by contrast was so incredibly detailed and complex if less dense than this title im also not stickler for bugs i know theyll get patched and fixed and that performance will improve what i did expect however is what was promised in this game there is advanced vehicle ai which means police chases simply can not happen thats system that was present in grand theft auto vice city npcs are lifeless and are barely worth interacting with the world strong art direction and can look quite beautiful at times but its far from breathing and routinely feels shallow and tired thanks to how repetitive and basic the npc and traffic routines are it reminds of mafia game where the open world is just set dressing serving effectively as long loading screen as you move from place to place but this isnt how the game was marketed from the offset they outright promised sandbox rpg featuring incredibly dense and novel npc interactions and narrative paths i didnt buy into everything they said of course but when your world is even less impressive than the last watch dogs game i have to wonder whats going onthe gunplay is punchy despite the inconsistent ballistics the upgrade tree is relatively cool if deceptively limited and the momenttomoment gameplay is all just serviceable its not an rpg i find to be particularly deep this is somewhat moot point but theres little gameplay here you havent already seen achieved more competently in titles like sleeping dogs deus ex and fallout driving feels dated as if the vehicles have substantial momentum to them its the little details that are truly noticeable like v not even sleeping correctly in his bed or qol considerations like the lack of dedicated walk button on keyboard that culminates in making the game feel average at best i have idea what happened with the life paths i was led to believe they would be as long and impactful as the origin stories in dragon age origins but theyre just 20minute starter sequences geared to introduce you to the world at breakneck speed they feel like cut contentthe good stuff here involves both the reliably impressive writing and story sequences yet thanks to the limited input you have for roleplaying it regularly feels like youre watching very cool television show its nowhere near as reactive and dynamic i had hoped not even half as much as the witcher 2 if this game only featured its story front and centre i would have given this positive review however it doesnt and i cant give thumbs up for undercooked ambition or good writing when its less than 25 of the experience especially with all this mediocre fluff surrounding it i say that even as someone who is willing to tolerate much for good story the amazing sequences you see are ironically those that would make for the best trailerbait and oh boy did theycyberpunks writing is far from perfect though especially in its presentation and pacing im never provided the means to care about v at all thanks to his introductory montage youre given relationships professional contacts and criminal

systems are its not bad thing to be derivative not always but if youve marketed your game as being anything but that from day one well people are going to noticei have doubt this game will improve in the next year in terms of its optimisation performance bugsquashing and maybe even additional content for now i would advise onthefence newcomers to steer well clear i would also recommend that you stay sceptical of people who want to lambast absolutely everything in this game as well as those who somehow think critical impressions are misguided at best or hate at worst certain elements of this game have been crafted with noticeable care and heartfelt attention to detail such as the side quests which can show real glimpses of brilliance i imagine few of the actual developers want to strangle the marketing and management teams right now and trust i get iti would have likely brushed this off as fine sometimes aboveaverage game ignoring the bugs and lack of innovative features as simply par for the course i may have given it positive review if it were honestly janky but featurecomplete closer to the promises we were given what i cant do is positively review product sold under wilfully and repeatedly false pretences thats weird for because i dont usually take principled stand if you can label cringe review as that i didnt much care about epic strongarming their way into the market for instance im not entirely sure how much of this ad campaign was straight deception on cdprs part and how much of it was comprised of wellwishing narratives that exploded out of control magnified by the sacred reputation gamers had anointed them with all while they found their feet in new and strange genre for whatever reason this time it feels odious maybe im just getting old,No

the next year in terms of its optimisation performance bugsquashing and maybe even additional content for now i would advise onthefence newcomers to steer well clear i would also recommend that you stay sceptical of people who want to lambast absolutely everything in this game as well as those who somehow think critical impressions are misguided at best or hate at worst certain elements of this game have been crafted with noticeable care and heartfelt attention to detail such as the side quests which can show real glimpses of brilliance i imagine few of the actual developers want to strangle the marketing and management teams right now and trust i get iti would have likely brushed this off as fine sometimes aboveaverage game ignoring the bugs and lack of innovative features as simply par for the course i may have given it positive review if it were honestly janky but featurecomplete closer to the promises we were given what i cant do is positively review product sold under wilfully and repeatedly false pretences thats weird for because i dont usually take principled stand if you can label cringe review as that i didnt much care about epic strongarming their way into the market for instance im not entirely sure how much of this ad campaign was straight deception on cdprs part and how much of it was comprised of wellwishing narratives that exploded out of control magnified by the sacred reputation gamers had anointed them with all while they found their feet in new and strange genre for whatever reason this time it feels odious maybe im just getting old,No

funny enough even the review portion of the game page on steam is bugged right now which pretty well sums up how this game went everyone heard all the controversy about bugs and performance issues and

really work what hacking there is is complete joke and nothing about the city manages to live up to the key theme of the cyberpunk genere which is the collision of society with the moral implications of future technology that is what this game promised to offer more deeply than exploring city or driving or shooting or roleplaying or upgrading your character which lord knows have been beaten to death in every aaa title for the past 10 years if i wanted to steal cars commit crimes and do jobs i can go play one of dozen driving themed games which stay in their lane cyberpunk is watered down version of gta in that it seems to most closely have taken inspiration from gta v probably because of the games commercial success and does everything down to the detail less well than game which predates it by more than 7 years there are moral decisions there are decisions at all but even the element of conflicting with future technology is only briefly implied with the dilemma of johnny keanu reaves and even then its less of discussion of the actual implications of the technology and more of an action movie about someone trying to save themselvespeople praising this game may have found something endearing and sure the story isnt bad its half dialogue which basically defeats the point of video game but whatever its decently written and well acted the mechanics arent terrible the gunplay is fine the driving is mediocre but passable but these people defending the game even now seem to be holding on to some strange delusion not only about the product that was initially promised but about the constant flaunting of missed potential everywhere in this gamesee not only does cyberpunk not live up to what is present tense advertised the last minute culling of scope is present everywhere in the city as half finished mechanics like brain dance vendors and oh i dont know police chases which its not like this was hard one to decide to include in game that managed to basically boil itself down to half assed driving game not only is it clear that the scope of the game was decreased massively as crunching ensued from poor management in early development but cdpr didnt even have the wherewithal to actually remove the fragments of scrapped mechanics im looking at you locked doors and public transit entrancesthe lack of anything that really resembles the aesthetic and sort of ethereal nature of cyberpunk in cyberpunk2077 isnt only depressing because its not there but because i have hard time believing that the thing thats missing from this game along

housing large chunks of the map functioning ai and pathing reasonable physics texture and model popping terrible hacking to name just few is that they arent likely to come with future patches i have hard time believing the base form of the game will get much more polish and tune up than bug fixes whether or not you agree that this game is missing the mojo it was supposed to have theres denying that the amount of things that need to be fixed in order to get this game in even the same ballpark as what was initially promised looks like another 10 year development cycle in and of itself at this point why would they even bother patching it to that extent they already sold millions of copies theres financial incentive to improve on the base game in any more ways than necessary i hope i eat my

editcyberpunk is the most disappointing game ive ever played after 2 months to marinate on it i firmly believe this to not be good gamecdpr delayed this game multiple times supposedly because they wanted to polish it and fix various bugs i have ryzen 7 3800x and an rtx 2070 super by means the greatest of rig but i can pretty much run anything you throw at decently as i play 1080p without rtx this game graphically was fine i shot north of 7080fps routinely with dlss on however i like to run rtx so i didfirst thing fps drops are insanely common and some are so bad i have to exit out of the game and launch back in because ill hit an area downtown that gives 35fps relaunch the game and then it settles at 5560 range which is amply playable rtx is extremely buggy and not welloptimized the graphics are beautiful not what i mean but ive read horror reports of peoples 3080s getting the same fps as at 1440p 3080s yanno nvidias flagship card that is supposed to do 4k at decent 5560 max everything secondly there are lot of bugs i have encountered very few bad bugs that make restart the game but there are many minor glitches and bugs which are irritating cdpr did not delay this for the purpose of polishing their move was solely corporate in nature they wanted more muneh gameplay is very fun for at least shooting hacking etc are all relatively simple and straightforward hacking is not the complicatedindepth mechanic showed to us in 2018 and 2019 its just simple pointclick magicmana system prevalent in multiple rpgs with cyberpunkgenre twistit all gets repetive though the perkattribute system i feel was well done the character development in terms of perk choice attributes and how it ties into gameplay flows well however they deleted and cut many perks that couldve added including the blocking bullets with your sword perksthe roleplaying elements suck i play male v and his voice even when is speaking thoughtfully or compassionately feels disconnected half the time sounds like typical passive aggressive merc who could care less the other half sounds only slightly less passive aggressive v is very unlikable character matter how you play him they even take away your ability to insert yourself as this character because his real name is supposed to be vincent or valerie even mass effect let you choose shepherds first name attributebackstory based rpg decisions literally boil down to pass conversation skill check that rarely genuine impact on the narrative unlike say fallout new vegas where skill checks are primary component of the narrativealso everything you saw in the trailers is literal 2 minute montage that shows how you became night city merc character buildup entry missions nothing the narrative is exceptional in my eyes so far at least in terms of writing panam takemura are deep wellwritten thoughtful characters with significant amount of emotional depth and i am very impressed by the writing of various side jobs as well as the main storyline romances are incredibly pointless and yield little to tangible results the storytelling of the characters is great doubt but v as character is unimpressive and forgetful you do not mold nor dictate his narrative the way cdpr told you you could another lie by cdprthe world is my single greatest issue with this game good way to describe it is as wide as an ocean and as deep as puddle cdpr spoke about the verticality aspect the verticality is largely tied to jobs and missions there is not much verticality in terms of pure openworld freeroam exploration yes there are layers of the city but its largely forgetful most world events boil down to gang do bad thing kill gang get money and equipment do not expect rdr2 level immersion you will not get it that was massive mistake for i came into this game with unimaginable hype levels and expected an immersive world i could get lost in unfortunately there is very little to do outside of gigs and jobs world events are virtually nonexistent outside of gangs doing stupid in terms of openworld immersion exploration rdr2 blows this out of the water contest this game immersionnight city is deceptively beautiful as it is visually and aesthetically pleasing game world but it doesnt rank in my top 10 gameworlds to actually play in weirdly enough i got more immersion from far cry 5s hope county than i did cyberpunks night cityyou cant even go to plastic surgeon or hairdresser in game with the core premise being body modification be happy with the way your character looks in the creation menu because once you launch the game thats it i am sure cdpr will change this at some point by adding in free contentedit change or plans for change like this so far that ive heardcyberware does not have the humanityethics concern to it when you use it cyberware is largely glorified stat and ability boostersgivers people were talking about minimal cyberware playthroughs for the sake of ethics and how it could affect the narrative it doesntcyberpunks music however is second to none and simply fantasticoverall this is an average title i enjoyed my time but i will not play this title again this games problem which many foresaw was the unimaginable hype that was built around it hype that was not matchable with the games final product i am sure cdpr will fix the technical issues as time goes by edit so far barelyi went into this game expecting 1010 masterpiece that will change the game that is not what i goti would give this title cyberpunk 2077 610 is this masterpiece is this goty is it an average game with good story and horrible management yes edit the main story is absolutely phenomenal this is one of the best stories ive had the pleasure of being part of cyberpunk 2077 despite its technical flaws and gameplay woes in terms of content provided an exceptionally memorable storyline and memorable characters story 910 characters 910 gameplay 810graphics 910immersion 210technical 210open world 510music 910overall 610edit i have to change this to not recommended simply because of the price and the lack of content available this story is worth experiencing but not at the price they are advertising because this game replayability value wait for half off get this game for like 2999 but in its current state with bad glitches bugs and total lack of content and severe lies by cdpr i can not recommend this title at 5999double edit i really go back and forth with this game sometimes i feel its horrific disappointment other times i feel its an okay game gameplay is fun but very repetitivewriting is decentstory is funworld is beautifulmost unimmersive open world ive ever playedworst ai ive seen in yearsoptimization sucksthis is not the worst game ive ever player however this is without doubt the most

heres the straighttothepoint n dirty toptobottom almostentirely spoilerfree version of cyberpunk 2077 at present after 60 hours of playtime ignore the extra 12 paused the game and forgot to shut it down before i went to bed one night is cyberpunk 2077 finished game absolutely not the ammo limit inventory limit and airandomlybreaking bugs are all very small but critical issues that need to be fixed ill expand upon these below is cyberpunk fully playable absolutely is cyberpunk 2077 fun you bet your ass it is is cyberpunk 2077 worth regular price atpresent id say so if youre someone who only plays for the story and doesnt care about doing side missions then youre going to get the absolute minimum out of cyberpunk 2077 as the game been built from the ground up with plethora of extra story content locked behind side mission decisionscompletion and on top of recommending you learn to actually enjoy games properly id also recommend you wait for cyberpunk 2077 to go on sale if thats the case but if you play games properly and enjoy exploring doing side missions and just generally messing about with ooh shiny icons on the map youll absolutely get your moneys worth from cyberpunk 2077 even at its current full price okay so whys everyone complaining about the game so the game some minor issues such as graphical issues during the cutscene sequencesanimations i say cutscene even though the game doesnt have any actual cutscenes to refer to moments where you become lockedinplace and can only look and select dialogue such as when youre with evelyn in judys bd basement theres sequence where evelyn gets out of her chair to walk over to judy only she doesnt actually animate out of the sitting position until shes 75 of the distance through her walk so for the first 34ths of the walk shes doing some harry potter seatedfloating magic or when youre in the taxi with jackie on the way to meet dex after getting shot up during the heist jackie goes to pull the biochip out of his head to give it to you except the animation forgets to remove his pistol so you see literally half of the barrel of his handgun protruding out the opposite side of his head and few more cases like this as the game progresses theres also the aforementioned issues with ammo limitsmanagement you have hardcap of 100 shotgun shells 100 sniper rounds 500 handgun and 700 rifle rounds only the game doesnt actually indicate this anywhere you have to test to figure it out or read other people complaining about it on forums who did their own testing where when you pick up craft or buy ammo above those limits the game will happily take your crafting components or money fill you to the limit and then just vaporize everything above that limit it doesnt drop on the ground it doesnt give you refund it doesnt even give you an error notice just poof already have maximum ammo great youre still able to waste your crafting components money crafting or buying more but its still going to just cease to exist with refund or warningthen the inventory management issue almost identical to ammo management you have maximum carrying capacity based on weight which thankfully can be increased through various means that the game does actually tell you about so whats the problem you can continue to craft pick up equipment above your maximum carrying capacity the game wont give you any notice or error it doesnt just drop excess equipment it just completely erases it found sweet legendary piece of gear in chest and picked it up when your inventory was already full apparently doesnt drop doesnt automatically get decrafted into components doesnt refuse to pick it up or even give you so much as courtesy warning it gets picked up the game realises that it doesnt fit in your remaining inventory space and just completely erases it from the game this is something i wouldnt even expect from firsttime indie developer much less cd projekt redthen theres also the notuncommon issue of enemy ai just completely breaking theyll be fighting running moving doing their thing and then just randomly break they stop moving stop shooting stop responding even if you shoot them or hit them with grenade they basically turn into boxingsparring dollthen lastbutnotleast the broken scrapper perk automatically disassembles all junk into components sounds great right but read on which doesnt have any filter for the valuable junk which is worth 750 and not just 3 and will happily disassemble them as well with way to turn it off besides complete skill reset which costs 100000 seriously guys you couldnt create tagword in the code for jewelry or even just an extra tab called jewelry or valuables to avoid this issue thankfully i had the foresight to avoid this particular issue myself by not getting the perk but ive read legions of lessmindful folks complaining about this on every game forum known to man since the game releasedwhich loops us back to the original why are people complaining long story short for those who dont already know massive expectations were dropped on the actual developers by the suitsupstairs at cd projekt red an unrealistic release date was set by the suits as all the developers flat out said this isnt possible this release date was pushed back several times as the suitsupstairs realized yep theyre right but we can still crunch it to this time period after several delays vocal group of potential consumers complained and whined and cried and pressured cd projekt red into releasing game that they flat out knew wasnt ready only to appease fans who then cried when loandbehold the game wasnt perfect and entirely finished the things they complained about had to be the 3 things i just mentioned because otherwise the game feels complete and most of the negative reviews dont actually cite any specific issue they just cry about how bad the game is its so terrible its not finished okay yes but howanyways the game supposedly based on some online articles cant personally verify if theyre true or not yet but i did see there were multiple possible options to go down different ending paths so theres at least few 6 distinct endings so you get lot of control over how things go down depending on your actions throughout the game mainly choices in certain sidequests as well as having to have completed certain side quests to unlock certain endings the city feels incredibly alive theres people everywhere you see ais regularly talk to eachother and with the infinitelygenerated ncpd combat minimissions and the plethora of sidemissions theres always something to do in almost every corner of the city seriously the only people getting bored in night city are people who either arent into fpss or who dont enjoy games properly and just blatantly ignore side quests and only focus on the main storyanyways thats my bit maybe ill see around at the afterlife kid stay safe out there,Recomendado,1,6876,50,Positivo,"['Inmersión en el mundo

i think after 249 hours and three full runs through the game and seeing the wide array of potential endings i can safely say i feel i certainly got my moneys worth with cyberpunk 2077 i bet you just glanced up to confirm i selected not recommended and you would be correct i did and i did it with heavy heartthe glorythere are countless moments where you see the raw passion in the art of making this game the many layers of architecture throughout the city the attention to detail in the vehicles the first time you run into random nameless npc just strumming guitar in sync to the music you hear them playing the rich and vibrant details to how the world works as explained in the opening sequences of the game the oversaturation of detail in every dark bright dirty clean and everything inbetween corner i genuinely feel i am playing work of art in video game form and that is rare praise from methe realityits work of art that you shouldnt look at too closely its problems start to show when you get too close can you blitz the game in half an hour yes but then youve missed 90 of the content it genuinely feels so rich yet so hollow the way sidecontent is delivered is the hollow throw darts on the map at random and expect the player to want to head to their respective markers this is quite boring however once youre there the mission is revealed to you and you are allowed to play it out how you want but can often be rewarded for playing it specific way sometimes defying the desires of the person who hired you these missions feel rich in story lore background but delivered in text message rivaling the length of this review not to mention all the data shards token replacements for entire conversations that likely had to be scrappedthe rotthen all the little cracks there are plenty of moments where objects npcs are interacting with will duplicate and stay frozen in the air near them the minimap is zoomed in too close to see turns coming up while driving edit fixed as of 13 that said the gps navigation is often broken and will zigzag through streets rather than take the fewest possible turns within reasonably similar distance traveled it does at least adjust whether youre on foot or in vehicle npc scripting often breaks forcing you to use an autosave to backtrack bit to give it another shot at working as intended this also teaches you to use your quicksave at prime opportunities so you dont lose much progress since autosaves arent frequent even just quicksaving and reloading will often fix lot of npc scripting onthespot weapons attributes stats and skills are horribly balanced mods on gear do stack but they dont want to show they stack on your stats screen edit stats now seem to be shown properly as of 121 you will occasionally just die at complete random at least i do and i cant figure out why from slight falls or getting hit by passing car edit instant deaths were identified and fixed as of 12 inventory panels have to reload with every transaction or dismantling this alone gets extremely tedious edit reloads are much faster now as of 12 but still tedious and many more minor annoyances and glitches will be encountered along the way none of which is consistent on userbyuser basis either many have it worse than many have had near flawless experience and theres accounting for the standards of the massesedit april 1st 2021i read through and tested the 12 update for few hours this fixed solid chunk of my nuanced details regarding bugsglitchesissues and is at least that much closer to its intended vision but theres entire systems and mechanics missing here still before that vision becomes reality on top of that many functions that were working before now dont work as intended such as scan toggle each time i launch the game now scanning is on hold i have to go to my keybinds switch it to hold apply then switch it back to toggle in order to get scan toggle to work again and there are more minor new bugsglitchesissues as well tested amd dxr functionality on settings that get 120 fps and full dxr drops framerates to staggering 30 i feel full control of dxr sample rates needs added so we amd users can tune thisedit september 1st 2021version 13 dropped with some free content added simple improvement to the minimap while driving and more quest scripting fixes raytracing implementation is still broken on amd considering doom eternal and re8 run just fine with it enablededit december 1st 2021no real changes just doing this dirty edit for the nomination awardsthe dreamfinally the real reason i dont recommend the game theres so much potential here not being realized there are less than five gangs in the city and i genuinely feel that core progress should be locked behind gaining reputation and prestige with at least one of them this could also drastically alter how the ending unfolds i hope someone at cdpr reads this because i would genuinely like to see fullon gang wars between their respective borders in the city ncpd and maxtac jumping into the fray shortly after these battles begin and let them be dynamic i would like to see system where you could earn reputation with all the gangs using an alias and keeping your face hidden if ever discovered on the other side of the fence instantly marking you traitor and to be dealt with in the way that gang operates it could be as simple as shooting someone who saw your face and not realizing they are still alive they report to their superiors and flip coin whether or not the gang finds out it was the player on top of that the player could turn the tide of war and go saints row on them by claiming territory from one gang for another they could even join the ncpd and eventually maxtac in much the same way even arasaka militech and biotechnica not to mention the nomad clans there should be exclusive mission boards per fixer gang ncpdmt corporation or clan rather than marks all over the map for missions ive seen how the fixers can be visited why not have them give you roster of potential missions to take on i wish you had been able to take another year or two developing these systems i see the potential for them like it was intended from the start but had to be cut because it would take too long to complete and im well aware of the fiveyear investment rule i know why you launched it like this and i know youre not allowed to admit this cold truth of business i wish you had waited to take on investment until you had timeline for finishing what couldve been real masterpiece for your studiotldrthe reason i do not recommend this game is because as it is now i feel it is work of art masterpiece video game that is lacking great deal of its true potential it is indeed worthwhile to buy and play as it is now

4510yeahyouve probably already heard all of the positive remarks about this game im not going to spend much time marking down the things i do like about elden ring but it would be disingenuous of if i didnt cop to somethingin order1 the ashes of war system is cool and the build variety it opens up is great theres lot of room for player expression moreso than previous titles and certainly more than sekiro2 certain parts of the game are breathtaking and the art direction is spot on for the most part3 theres lot of weapons armors rings etc etc its very easy to make your character look good and lot of the unique weapons feel great to play with4 fighting boss when its done right still feels pretty great that feeling when you dodge at just the right time never gets oldaaaand thats kind of it ill be honest it took minute to scrounge up even thatim just going to go over the major elements that led to scoring the game the way i didthe worldi am incredibly critical of open world games perhaps to fault ive always struggled to find merit in these types of games and they rarely if ever hook in the appeal for of an open world is the prospect of living world that i can get lost exploring in now the open world concept is essentially the tagline of elden ring and you spend an assload of time in it so how does it shape up it doesnt not even in the slightest bit now the world isnt empty let make that clear ahead of time too often do critics of this game latch onto that word and time and time again youll see the fans counter with theres tons of stuff in the world its not empty at all and theyre right theres plenty of stuff the problem is that it almost all suckstheres lot content in terms of quantity theres countless enemies dungeons and merchants but it essentially all boils down to the same routine in the overworld fight some trashmobs loot some items in dungeon fight some trashmobs loot some items kill boss wow leave theres narrative stringing you along through any of this locations barring the main quest and there towns or villages to relax or morp around in the whole world of elden ring is vast expanse of nothingness with bunch of filler riding the coattails of the main story areas lazily hidden by your horse weve seen this formula time and time again in games from developers like ubisoft usually to much criticism but is it really that much different here when you pull away the soulsy veneer ask yourself if it werent for torrent how alive would the world feel if you were stuck on footlevel designthe level design is not good im going to piss off lot of people by saying that but its true the fundamental issue with the levels in elden ring is that there is virtually reason at all to fight the enemies fromsofts design philosophy coalesces into perfect storm of ââââââââââ lot of the time where the inherent risks of fighting enemies almost always outweighs any of the incentive to do so the enemies respawn if you die even once and the runes youre going to get from the boss will far outclass anything youre gon na scrounge out of even 100 mangy dogs so why not just run through the whole thing seriously how is that not the optimal way to play youre routinely presented with situations where youre outnumbered and entirely outclassed by the level enemies and fans will tell you to fight but why you dont have to to progress the only thing in the way of you getting to the next area is the boss that always nagged about fromsoft games and its made even worse here with all of the magic spam and other teethpulling ââââââââ you have to put up with you cant tell that benny hilling around the map is good game design you just cant questlinesthe quests in this game if you can really call them that are bad theyre very bad the souls series isnt really known for its arresting side characters or engrossing bplots so this isnt too much of shock and normally wouldnt be huge problem for the issue though is that the open world nature of elden ring mutates the already pretentious questing system of previous games into even more of nuisance heres breakdown of the only quest i bothered completing with the help of guide1 meet yura bloody finger hunter underneath bridge at limgrave lake2 warns you about the dragon this is the only thing does and there is indication whatsoever of any kind of quest related to him3 ride clear across the lake into random ravine get dismounted off your horse and fight some bloodyfinger guy yura spawns in and then says some random dialogue about the guy youre fighting while you mash him4 despawns and then reappears at the very end of the ravine in cave again indication whatsoever about where hes at5 talk to him congratulates you and purrs at your martial prowess and then warns you about some crazy lady named eleonora quest over6 wrong there is now summon sign clear across the map in raya lucaria at the end of broken bridge yes you read that right7 use the summon sign fight some random npc with yura get sent back on the bridge and be careful not to miss him as hes now leaning on the railing behind you8 talk to him get an ash of war quest done9 wrong again teleports clear across the map again to random church in the atlus plateau this time you find him sprawled out neardeath on the church floor giving an operamonologue about his beloved eleonora you stand around awkwardly waiting for him to croak then loot the sword off his stillwarm body10 just as youre about to leave eleonora spawns in gasp you fight her and then get polestaff11 quest done does that not sound like the stupidest âââââââ thing youve ever heard in your entire life this appears to be the standard of elden rings quests 0 direction 0 investment and 0 idea about what the ââââ is going on the way theyre designed prevents you from ever really being the active agent in any of the quests you undertake youre not experiencing the beats of quest because you intend to they kind of just happen to occur if youre in the right place at the right time and if mercury is in retrograde and the north star is juuust bright enough coupling that with the fact that theres actual decisionmaking expected on your part you get the comedic impression that youre just some âââââââ extra at the school play whos so good at getting in the way that the actual actors in the show have to improvise some on the spot nonsense to keep the whole production from being torn down by your meddling i actually busted up laughing when yura died it almost feels intentionalconclusiontheres lot of other stuff i could touch on but im already out of space here so ill keep this brief if you like all of the other souls games you might like this i dont for all the reasons above am i going to keep playing it though yeah probably am i going to like

this game felt dated when it released 10yrs ago and 10 more years of rereleases hasnt helped at all the combat is oblivions but instead of talking 400 hits to kill the 100th draugr deathlord in generic cave you only do it in 200 or so with cleaner animations and janky kill moves which gets the player killedthe game is shallow none of you decisions impact the world or effect the story and there are many elements of tonal dissonance where one quest line focuses on heroic archetype and another on murdering people but the heroic one feels urgent from the get go and it just feels weird to go oh alduin end of the world who gives lets go rob some for 100 hrs the blades parthunaax conflict is the most forced conflict i have ever seen like 3000 years later oooo we have grudge when the blades in recent times were like the cia of the empire not really militant order much more compelling conflict would be if they expanded on the conflict between the blades and thalmor because that actually is relevant to recent conflicts and not to dragon who is the main reason like humans arent enslaved and dragons should be portrayed as characters and people not flying lizards with zero intelligence there couldve been much more interesting story if the story like made u interact with them as characters either to build motive besides cartoonishly evil or like sway dragons to your cause to defeat alduin odaviing says the dragons have been becoming discontent with alduin this shouldve been expanded on as plot pointmorrowind did better job of this as the main quest felt important but there wasnt an urgency in accomplishing it the tribunal been having war of attrition with dagoth ur for years and there were many points where side content intersected with the main quest and plot points in it making side content by extension feel meaningful to the story as whole alsomagic and alchemy have been watered down since previous games and are boring unbalanced chore if you dont use mods to overhaul said systems in morrowind for example enchanting and alchemy was great way for player to get access to nice utility magic effects potion was method of casting some spells same with enchanted items but with either constant on hit or on cast for non mage focused player all utility been removed from magic in skyrim and the lack of spell crafting really kills the fun you could of have with it but its unlikely bethesda will ever include it again its ridiculous to make world that scales with the player but doesnt make the magic scale adequately with it another thing i dont find entirely compelling is that your character cant screw up and you cant make wrong decisions only one quest did this in skyrim while almost every faction quest in morrowind allowed for thisto sum up the factions questswinterhold go through 35 dungeons then your suddenly skilled enough to become the archmage of an academic institution yeah nah you can clear this without focusing on any magic and whoever made this quest line needs to remove whatever metal rod is lodged in their brain before they take up writing ever againcompanions beat up some poor farmer in the name of honour go to crypt and learn that ur in werewolf cult beat up another farmer to honour ysgramors legacy be forced to be made werewolf for some reason even though 3 out of the 5 leaders dont want to be anymore kill ton of werewolf hunters kill some witches come back to see they retaliated at home base go on lame revenge mission come back get awkwardly handed legendary weapon read kodlacks journal where u learn really liked you even though u only talked like once to him go through another generic nordic crypt slay wolf spirit the endthieves guildwhere the companions was way to quick in pacing they dragged out the interesting missions and the ability to become guild master with the most god awful grind fest of radiant quests who ever came up with that idea should be firedthe main questline in the faction is basically do few smallish jobs heists and such be forcefully inducted into another daedric cult becoming the champion of the hundredth daedric god because apparently someone who can slay someone who may be an avatar of akatosh is too weak to kill someone with keydawnguard faction fine overall had its moments wasnt particularly exceptional but it was exceptional that it felt like it wasnt written by someone with brain aneurysm which is amazing considering their track recordvampire faction same as dawnguard but vampires my only beef is that it suffers from lack of any real difference to dawnguard main quests and also pretty terrible tonal dissonance if you havent finished main quest as youre rail roaded to be hero gasp dragon born what an honor but youre also vampire who treats humans as cattle it doesnt fit in tonally with most other quest lines and factions as there is real like morally ambiguous way to complete most quest linesdark brotherhoodits alright but there is some down right smooth brained writing once again basically u kill bunch of useless characters proceed to plot to kill emperor kill the emperors spiessecret police leaders you get handed over on plater to him because obviously will forget the dark brotherhood murdered his if you and wont have anyyyyyyyy grudges because thats logical and good writing yeah its stupid the quests in oblivion overall were much better and intricate with more compelling characters and the assassins guild in morrowind was interesting as it lead up to you killing highly important characters essential for multiple quest lines making who you kill have an impact in the worldoverall as ive said before its shallow and skyrim was my first rpg and bethesda game so its not really nostalgia for older games why i think so i believe their focus in development was poor for example the major cities in skyrim have less buildings and are far smaller than towns in morrowind which released in 2002 and instead you have over hundred samey dungeons when dungeons were never the thing that made rpg games good its the world and how the player leaves mark on it morrowind does this and new vegas does alsoi wouldnt be surprise if the next game is 3 minute long 2d cartoon because bethesda seems to look at their past games and remove any traits that made them compelling such as complex story unique magic mechanics factions that actually meant something and character that grows to fit the world and not the world revolving and around the characterif bethesda wants to make good game next they need to focus on what the core mechanics will be there been greater popularity in deeper more in depth complex rpg experiences since skyrim launched which have become far more mainstream and if they dont bring anything new to the

im not sure where to start with cyberpunk 2077 this game many problems starting with bugs and optimization to gameplay and story building keep in mind when reading this i had lower expectations than most with this game but still believed it would have been good game just not as good as everyone was hyping it up to be when first beginning my adventure into cyberpunk i walk outside the starting car to 2 different groups of thugs floating on top of each others heads given that was on the first day of release i dont mind too much considering every game these days are released with butt load of bugs and eventually problems like this will be fixed not only did i find these thugs floating as soon as i exited the door npcs are clipping through elevators doors and walls while talking with and getting to their destination optimization is also complaint for many i dont understand why the recommended specs for this game involve 1060 matter what graphics settings i change the game still nearly the same performance but again this is common in many games so im not going to fault cyberpunk specifically for this problem just something i wish many games would resolve that being said i have 1080 and an i7 7700k and only getting max of 60fps when playing on medium settings only about 5 fps more than playing with everything set to max speaking of graphics this game doesnt seem to be special in any regard with their graphics and i actually recommend you check out this video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4dwtwbpxzv8 to see the differences between ultra and low sometimes it seems as though lower is better just to reduce the amount of blur they use when on ultra and it seems as though there is real significant difference when playing on one or the other i thought amazing atmosphere and breathtaking visuals was something cyberpunk was striving to get but these visuals are simply not impressive they arent bad either but after taking break from the game i went off to red dead redemption 2 and man the difference was night and day graphically speaking onto the gameplay at the very beginning aside from the bugs i was roped in the story was really nice and the graphics seemed impressive at that point but once you get 2 hours in you walk out of your apartment ready to take on the world the atmosphere here is fantastic i felt like little boy in the middle of huge open world hopped in my car and drove around with nearly nothing to do i figured well it is the beginning i was just introduced to the world ill do few more missions and see what more opens up i meet new people get more mechanics thrown at and at that point it changed nearly nothing just more upgrades and neat gadgets to do things with that were niche at best hacking only gives you 3 options after beginning the game attack distract or take over take over cameras hack into people and damage them or activate light tv or forklift to distract the enemy it is nearly useless to use these mechanics unless you want to distract the exact same copy pasted bulletsponges not to mention when you hack someone and blow up their phone or cyberware and damage them they do not bat an eye unless you actually see you you can hack wait minute hack again until they are dead this right here i thought was bit embarrassing they dont even try to walk around and find you its similar to skyrim npcs getting hit with an arrow and believing it was their imagination once i even had civilian drive near turf shootout and sit there staring at us shooting instead of panicking driving off she sat there because my car was stuck in the way in front of tens of guys shooting near her i truly feel like gta v npcs were more impressive and that game came out in 2013 there are also cyberpsychos who were really hyped up in the first side mission to be cool diverse murdering cops and innocents then retreating into their little cave but i quickly found out after fighting 3 of them they are exactly the same and even the ai here is bit wacky you fire an entire magazine into them and they magically dodge half the bullets that are being fired straight into them their ai is also only programmed to stay in one specific spot if you get out of their fight zone theyll stand there and let you keep firing or hack to your hearts contentfinally the story i thought the very introduction was really interesting at first as i said it roped in gave the characters some personality and hyped up for really nice solo experience until i finished the introduction and found my way into nightcity once i awoke and started my adventure it just felt like chore im sitting with someone talking about job who tells to get in car and talk with someone about job i then murder for said object then sit with someone and talk about job granted im only 4ish hours into the story but so far i just cant tell whats happening and i just dont seem to care about whats happening its just job to job and for some reason the big boss giving out jobs cares about specifically for real reason when confronted with the question just says im more trustworthy when i just met the guy the only praise i can say with this story is within these fetch quests is the ministories there are really cool and dont seem super scripted it felt really interactive when choosing my dialogue then something would happen and im slowly regretting that decision but on the decision side of things i suppose this could be slight spoiler so beware everyone gets their own introduction when playing but after the intro everyone is put into the exact same spot so not every experience seems like it will be tailored into your own unique storyfinishing this review off i just want to say that cyberpunk 2077 really the atmosphere and world building for great game but because the gameplay and story lacks so much i dont know what this game could become the open world really seems nearly dead with every side quest seeming to be exactly the same with random punks wanting to kill you for scraps there is so much left to be desired with this game and the gameplay is nothing shy of b tier ubisoft game truly it feels like watchdogsthe division but i suppose thats giving it some praise because at least watchdogs had really cool unique things with their hacks but pretty much thats about what i have to say thank you to anyone for reading i do not recommend this game in its current state and it seems like it would take quite bit of time for the game to really be something special though in the end i am happy the team hopefully gets small break after being in crunch mode for over year ill definitely give this game another shot over time and update my review accordingly since i want this to be as accurate as it can be,No recomendado,0,6710,57,Negativo,[],"['Problemas

this review pains to write as i really loved the game and wished to enjoy my time with it unfortunately there are many short comings to this game at its current state that i just can not give good review for major spoiler warning aheadmy opinions without spoilers will be at the tldr section at the bottomlets first get this out of the way the map design and visuals are gorgeous my first steps into leyndll capital and the stunning nokron and nokstella cities gave feeling ive never felt in any of the hundreds of the games ive played this is doubt the most immersive and enjoyable world fromsoftware ever madethe amount of content in this game is also unfathomable the amount of details and secrets such as the hidden sellia tunnel or the countless talismans and quests made eager to explore every nook and cranny of this worldthe sound design is also stellar not only are the boss soundtracks absolutely enjoyable my favorite without doubt is the tibia mariners theme but the sound design in general is mesmerizing the latin chants of the manbats or the cries of the cowmans to name few are hypnotic to say the least however there are many shortcomings to this state that made my experience unenjoyablelets first talk optimization as i feel this applies to the most amount of users the optimization at the games current state is simply horrendous per my experience the game could rarely run smoothly at 60fps with the lowest settings on my gtx 1070ti with 16gb ram and i78700 im also encountering framedrops or frameskipping in every boss fight granted these are not the best specs but they are at least better or at onpar with average graphic cards these days friend of mine who 3080 and i9 core could rarely achieve great frame rates at high settings and others who had poorer specs could barely run the game at allofcourse turning the resolution down and altering graphics files could net an increase in frame rates but players shouldnt be forced to juggle nay choose between immersiveness and playabilitynext is the boss designs dont get wrong lots of the boss designs are incredibly amazing and interesting especially true of the demigods however this only lasts for the earlymid portion of the game many of the minibosses are overrecycled and most bosses just become war of attrition or worse luck i understand that this is huge openworld game and there are limited resources for development but when you are fighting your 7th ulcerated tree spirit or 6th erdtree avatar the encounters themselves simply feel unrewarding and boring i am also particularly disappointed with the reuse of the naturalborn of the void the main appeal of this lovecraftian scorpion is that its supposed to be onetime encounter with being that should not exist in the game world it should be horrifying and provide only hint of what could exist in order to create lingering dread and fear in the players however when it is reused again in simple icecave it just destroys the whole experience at least for methe bosses are also extremely unbalanced i know i know git gud just dodge bro but it feels like this title heavily caters towards sorcerers and abusing summons for the early game the game doesnt expect you to have good spells good stats or good summons and so the bosses feel fair and closerange attacks feels powerful this is flipped completely in the later portion for my playthrough i was using hybrid int build i could simply summon 10 oleg knight have it tank all the damage and spam fullmoons until whatever is infront of is obliterated this made the game uninteresting and so i switched to strengthfaith build and i can say that it was completely hell on earth it feels as through all of the boss attacks are targeted towards meleeplayers the magma wyrm attacks astel voidborn aoes and many other attacks is nonthreatening to ranged users and lethal to melee users because of the summons the rests between each attack from bosses are cut extremely short compared to other souls games as they expect you to be playing essentially 2 on 1 or 2 on 2 this created dilemma in which playing without summons and melee builds is extremely challenging while playing with summons as sorcerer is extremely unfun and repetitivealso most bosses are not challenging by design but are simply scaled up to one shot you if you dont dodge random bs ability 476 like ffs why does the black knife ring leader have like 500million health while being able to track and one shot you with his jump aoesid like to bring up sekiro in comparison sekiro did the gameplay system perfectly at least imo where the boss attacks dont feel random but is challenge of skills if you fail to parry thats on you if you fail to recognize the chain combos thats on you if you parry everything you get an opportunity to retaliate or heal in eldenring its not the same lets say you get hit by ability you are now faced with two decisions heal or not heal due to the short times between attacks it is essentially gambit random roll of dice of whether you get punished for healing or not this is as i mentioned because summons exist and so the game is balanced to the summonsthe fights themselves turn into battle of attrition of whoever runs out of health or flasks first and whoever is the luckiest instead of true dance and true combat of skillquestslastly the quest system is also abominable it is unwelcoming to veteran souls players and completely confusing to new players considering this very well could be the first souls game or even the first ever game that someone plays though i did enjoy doing some quests and feeling like satisfied after linking the dots between questlines how on earth are you supposed to progress main quest lines such as seluvis plot without looking up guide to find hidden tunnel in the billions of ruins or how do you know without exploring for hundreds of hours where brother corhyn went after just simply left the roundtable without even hint of where hes headingofcourse the games not supposed to let you know everything but at least give slight hint or direction you explore and finish the entire game without completing single questline even when you are ecstatic to do sotldrthe game is immersive and interesting with jawdropping visuals and some unique mechanics however due to the atrocious optimization poor balancing and perplexing quest system i simply can not recommend it at its current statei emphasize at its current state because i wish that most of the complaints will be addressed and i would love to absolutely adore this game however it is sadly not the case right nowthat said im going to be playing more eldenring because despite my complaints it is pretty fun,No recomendado,0,6674,58,Negativo,"['Map

tldr dont buy its unfinished and simply not what was promised i personally enjoyed it thoalso review is based on my experience with the game in 2020early 2021general thoughtsfirst off i enjoyed my 50 hours with cyberpunk so fari encountered small amount of bugs which were mostly funny or dumb in nature or minor annoyance at moststill under circumstances do i wan na overlook the horrendous state the game wasstill is in on other platformshardwarein my opinion the game should have never been announced for lastgen consolesalso the implementation of rtx appears to have made huge impact on development the game is poorly optimized doubtlets dig bit deeperperformancegraphicsi run 3070 and ryzen 5600x at the moment decent hardware one could say still on ultra settings 1080p i get measly 70fps average city center dips to the 50fps range occasionally not bad but still disappointingthe game changer here really is dlss turn this setting to quality or performance further everything beyond performance is gon na look like cereal dlss boosts my fps by about 40 on average which is impressiverendering and texture streaming seem to have been heavily gutted to make the game run on the old console generation which is sad to see i often encountered missing textures or textures that were low quality popping in suddenly becoming hdand these are just few of the visual bugs i encounterednow i can look past that mostly but it still leaves that feeling of oh god i wasted money on thison the other hand the game is simply stunning visuals and textures are solid across the board lighting even without rtx on is really nice the game creates lot of atmosphere just with the visuals alonethere is so much attention to detail in everything the cars the different city districts the houses the advertisements etc etc etccharacter models are beautifully done dont get started i think panam rogue judy kerry etc are some of the most convincing and beautiful character models ive ever seenthe main characters are total feast for the eyes they are truly sight to behold and make playing the sidequests so much more worth itaudiosound designvoice actingi had some big issues with the audiothe biggest problem is that some parts of environmental audio just keep cutting in and out randomlythere are cutscenes in which you only hear your character grunting despite being in fight while beating someone to the ground it gets extremely awkward at timesalso people will deliver some sentences with completely different cadence with completely different voice filtersetup as if rerecordedand those moments arent far and inbetween it happens all the timevoice acting is well done for the most parteven pedestrian oneliners sound believableespecially for the main characters their voices carry lot of well character hahexcept for the two most important charactershow could they this upfirst off vive only played female v so far but its been really disappointing and even cringe at some pointsv just sounds so disinterested at best v manages to sound cynical and edgy maybe sarcastic the rest is some mix of neutral and tired its really weird the female voice actor sounds like purposefully lowering their tone to sound toughi hate itsecondly johnny silverhandits less bad than on v i like keanu reeves as an actor and i adore lot of the roles playedi think johnnys voice acting is okayish for the most part but theres little character in it there are situations in which johnny just sounds so outof placehave listen to some of johnnys voicelines during tense moments and youll agree with meit feels like the actors for v johnny and some others very occasionally havent been properly introduced to the scene theyre playingthis only gets amplified by the audio bugs i mentioned aboveit really hurtsthe music ingame is some of the best and most emotionally impactful ive heard in any gameit is simply amazing give listen to bells of laguna bend or outsider morethe score beautifully underlines the important story moments and perfectly builds tension where it is neededradio music and fighting ambience are okay but become stale quickly nothing special heregameplaygameplay is i dunno alrightmost side quests are the usual fetchkillbring and deliver add all the other stuff one would expect from an openworld rpgadventurestory and sidequests are done nicely i enjoyed all of the meaningful quests thouroughlygunplay feels nice the melee weapons are okay but kinda obsoleteperks do basically next to nothing for you for being advertised as an rpg the skill trees feature next to new abilities only percentual bonuses to stats you or your weapons might haveapart from quickhacking and stealth the perks have little impact on how you playthe most impactful upgrades are the cyberneticsthe whole skill system feels like rushed afterthoughtbugs here are limited to certain quest triggers not happening forcing you to reload save filenot too bad i havent had any quests hardlock my game yetnpcs are laughable apart from the usual shopkeepers and vendors or questrelated npcs the pedestrians are totally replaceableall they can do is walk around cower in fear run away or drive straight its honestly impressive how much cdpr was able to contradict their own promisesi mean the npcs literally disappear when you walk block daily routine my assi wouldve loved more clothing and weapon variety there are probably only 15 weapons in the game varying in stats and paint finish if at all clothing is bit better but it still sucked to walk into store look at the sleek designs on the walladverts and not being able to buy anything shown in the advertsstorythe story is nicely done in my opinionits nothing praiseworthy intense heartwrenching drama gigantic plottwistsbut the story and dilemma of v creates lots of stuff to think and talk aboutthe notion of self gets questioned family death afterlife and personal growth play big roles theres criticism on basically any modern way of living everywhere but cdpr managed to not overdo it to the point of sjwismi wont go into much detail here but i enjoyed the story extended through sidequests lotconclusioncyberpunk 2077 is guilty pleasuremaybe i am easy to impress but if i can find one or two things that make game interesting for its worth playing and liking to the characters story and love to detail really saved this game in my eyesthere are glaring issues that will definitely ruin the experience for many playersbut to face the facts this game isnt recommendableat this point january 2021 it doesnt come close to aaa experiencecdpr promised to redo big parts of the game until june 21 so maybe get the game then,No recomendado,0,6628,59,Negativo,"['Visuals and textures', 'Attention to detail in design', 'Character

simply disappointed the witcher 3 is one of my favorite games of all time the story the characters the open world all memorable engaging and interesting safe to say my expectations for cyberpunk 2077 were high i didnt expect it to be better than the witcher 3 but i did think it would be the next game that you could remember for long time spoiler it is not lets start with something positive though the game is gorgeous i played on rtx 3080 and amd 5900x with ray tracing set to maximum settings with fully ray traced global illumination interiors are probably the best i have ever seen and the outside areas are simply stunning as well the world is reflecting in small water puddles after it rained and shadows are cast through the skyscrapers to the lower streets while the open world looks beautiful though its all façade it doesnt feel real let explain npcs simply walk up and down street and do not interact with you at all gta v which came out in 2013 way more immersive open world gta also actually good police chases or should i say it even police chases when you kill an npc in cyberpunk you can gets stars just like in gta but the police will not chase you nooo if they are close to you they will just try to kill you on sight simply drive away 200m and they forgot with setting like cyberpunk you could have had drones chasing you or even just police cars but none of that exists another thing i noticed is that i cant remember anything from the open world you could show picture from part of the world in gta the witcher 3 or red dead redemption 2 and i could tell you where that is here it all feels the same real landmarks nothing memorableok the world looks beautiful but it doesnt feel immersive at all what about the storysimply said its alright completely forgettable after one play through the characters for the most part are boring and wont be remembered very long the three background stories you can select at the start are meaningless and offer nothing more than few dialogue options in your playthrough its huge missed opportunity and it doesnt help that you dont get much if any background on v you simply want to become legend in night city for whatever reason one strong suit are the side quests though they are the most interesting part of the game you can engage in variety of activities with lots of easter eggs and often fun dialogue select amount of larger side quests tie into the games ending but in very unnatural way if you completed the side quests you are offered an additional option in the final quest there could have been more elegant solutions but its passable all in all the story is the part that disappointed most the witcher 3 had masterful story and i expected something similar but what we got is honestly on the same level as watch dogs alright passable you wont remember itbut wait there is more gameplaythought getting calls in gta was annoying well youre in luck you are getting called all the time it is bad really bad ive also had countless occasions where i was in dialogue in the main story and got call from side quest like wtf both dialogues overlap at that point and the already broken immersion is completely ruined with that out of the way the actual gameplay is alright shooting is passable but wont win any prizes melee combat is straight garbage hacking seems completely useless and i never really utilized it that is because the ai is just not good they cant adapt to you quick enough most of the time just standing in the open and shooting at you as i said before look at gta v not to mention red dead redemption 2 or even the witcher 3 the ai there was better if you buy the double jump cyberware upgrade the game breaks btw and the ai is overwhelmed by the positions you can reach character customization is also flat out bad if you go for the best armor stats you look like clown make clothing exclusively visual or look at literally any other game that released in the last years to see how to make system where you have clothing stats but can still choose your style as you want itcrafting frankly its not obtainable when you play the story to upgrade to legendary quality items you need to spend 18 points into the crafting skill tree which is just bad decision to make while playing but even after youve done that the required amount of materials are ridiculously expensive and probably wont be possible to obtain for large number of players the leaves the skill tree and the inventory system the prior is good you get tons of options to skill to your preferred play style and i feel like the skills are impactful for the most part the inventory system is unfortunately copied from the witcher 3 its not great the weight on items and the weight limit on your inventory is annoying and doesnt add anything to the game ive gotten to this part and have not even mentioned bugs much but they cant be ignored the game is in disastrous state on release you cant get through single quest without having three animations completely break sounds missing and sometimes trigger just refuses to work entirely the performance is also not good and even with my setup the game only uses 40 of the gpu which just shows its not very well optimized or programmed so can i recommend it not right now if you expect the next huge game that will be talked about for long time because of the story you will be hugely disappointed if you look for good rpg you will be disappointed if you look for good firstperson shooter you will be disappointed if you look for good open world game you will be disappointed if you look for the probably bestlooking open world game that takes place in large city though then this might be just right for you but even if thats what you want wait the game is in an awful technical state and i would not recommend buying it right now if you are not 100 sure you have setup that can run the game somewhat stable closing thoughts the game got rated 1010 and 910 by most major news outlets and i believe thats just objectively wrong if the cd project red logo was switched out for ea or ubisoft that game would be ripped apart by everyone in my opinion there is clear bias because of how good the witcher 3 was if any other company had released game in such bad shape there would be outrage by the outlets with talks about long term impacts and trust in the company not so in this case i have doubt that the bugs can and will be fixed in the future but even if the game was running perfectly its not better than 710,No recomendado,0,6495,60,Negativo,"['Gráficos impresionantes',

good looking mess i love cyberpunk fiction the original blade runner is one of my favorite movies of all time and ive been always fan of the theming when i heard of this back in 2013 it looked like the best thing ever although even back then i had my doubts about the project it seemed too ambitiousi ended up getting this game on sale and while i had fun with it i got ta say that even at 50 off i cant recommend this mess and heres whythe goodfirst id like to mention what i enjoy the most about this game and that is the aesthetic the vehicles the interiors the stores the characters the clothing the different city districts i loved how unique they felt and how well they fit the genre the game looks great and the cyberpunk atmosphere is very well done thats what makes this somewhat unique and makes it stand out since the game such great looking visuals and places i spent lot of time taking screenshots and using the photo mode depending on where youre at the game looks phenomenal that was my favorite part of it using the photo mode and trying bunch of different style concepts managed to create some very nice wallpapers out of it the photo mode is very robust letting you switch from 1st to 3rd person move your character around bit and even pose for it i just wanted more focus related options and the ability to switch views during cutsceneanother great thing about this game is the character creator while its not the most complex ive ever seen it gets the job done and gives you good enough freedom to create good looking player or hideous monster for an open world game like this its great additionsome of the characters in the main story can be considered highlight i wish we could spend more time with them though outside of missionsthe progression system is also worth mentioning there are considerable amount of perks to buy lot of them are useless but it gives you somewhat of freedom enough to change some gameplay elements like the gunplay the stealth the hacking making specific missions easier and bit differentthe badok so despite having fun with the game i have to say why i cant recommend this mess the games all over the place it feels very rushed and like it an identity crisis thats where most of the problems are sometimes the game wants to be big open world sandbox other times it wants to be those very story driven scripted walking simulators for the first couple of hours you dont get the scope of how bad things are probably because the first few missions are heavily scripted even more than the usual because of that not many glitches occur to be honest the entire games scripted ass hell but the beginning is even worse like those theme park rides that are on rails the devs market the game as being this awesome rpg where you choices matters with bunch of different paths such bull they give you the illusion of choice when you start the story lifepaths but they literally dont matter youll just get different prologue and some random dialogue choices throughout the game that dont make any significant difference at all the games half dozen different endings but to get them only handful of choices youll make during the story will actually make any difference the plot its moments but i found it too linear for what they promised like i said some of the characters are great that was the only time i actually gave s about what was going on too bad you cant change anything other than the endingin reality its all smoke and mirrors at first it seems like the city is great and everything as you progress you get to see how shallow and pointless it all is the game doesnt have nearly enough variety to feel alive or make you come back to it you always see the same cars on the streets the same npc interaction and most of the side missions are very repetitive the apartments you buy offer absolutely nothing somethings you can only do at the starting one the cars you own you cant even change or choose colors so if you end up buying very cool car but it comes in brown or something boring theres way around it the character customization in terms of cyberware the implants you use to enhance your character is very limiting as well there are respectable variety of them and they do provide new gameplay features but they dont change anything in terms of looks for game that relies so much in aesthetic this is such wasted opportunity i wish we had more freedom in that department like the npcs with crazy implants and chrome i want thatand why the hell didnt they make 3rd person mode again for game that so much going on in terms of aesthetic and looks the only unique thing about this game they sure got lot of things wrong so you customize your character buy all these different clothes and the only time you get to see it is in the mirror or in the photo mode i cant wrap my mind around thatohh and the bug how can i forget them theyre everywhere there are all kinds of glitches visual ones like textures not loading blurry ads on buildings and some very weird ones like cars exploding out nowhere bunch of npcs reacting with the same looped animation right next to each other stupid pathfinding people floating npcs and vehicles clipping through objects talking corpses enemies with 0 health still fighting the list goes on and on those glitches are not rare occurrences they happen often and i have them all recorded fanboys like to claim they havent encountered any game breaking bugs and theyre not lying but dont be fooled while theyre not technically game breaking theyre very frequent and they come in all shapes and forms game thats been in development for such long time with such high expectations and they couldnt get the basics of an open world wowthe marketing campaign they made for this game was huge deception and the way they paid out early reviews was outright dirty the devs knew what they were doing and they chose to release this rushed mess anyway we cant justify it by its current state which is still far cry from what it was advertised as this game deserves all the hate it got and matter how great they turn this game in the future it wont erase its tainted story and all the people they deceived into preordering this joke nasty things like this in the gaming industry are becoming common and we cant allow this type of behavior cyberpunks plot is all about not trusting big corporations well i guess they got this part right,No recomendado,0,6398,61,Negativo,"['Aesthetic', 'Character Creator', 'Some characters in the main story', 'Progression system']","['Rushed

21 enero probably my most anticipated game of 2022 and when i first started the game up and entered the lands between i was in gamer heaven an open world dark souls game whats not to like well after almost completing the game my thoughts are this game is really bad overall im going to start with the goodthe combat and movement and other stuff regarding the player really an improvement form dark souls 3 but downgrade from sekiro not that it had to be exactly like sekiro but blend of dark souls 3 and sekrio would have been nice not the case its basically dark souls 3 with smoother response times and jump which is really nice addition other aspects of the game design i liked was the crafting and the horse awesome additions especially with the open worldgraphicslove the visuals of this game and the boss designs are amazing basically perfect not photo realistic obviously i told myself when i first bought the game id go down to the coast and check out the cliffs i did and was blown away at the shear size of them really set the tone at an eleven the rest of the game does not hold up to these first impressions but man was i excited at the early stages there are allot of massive too scale environments that youll be blown away by at first and then later ton of stuff is not scaled correctly thats all the good i can think of theres the obvious like voice acting and music but those are givens with fromsofts games at this point my favorite npc was the blacksmith really liked whoever did his voice acting all of them are good thoughthe bad the pacingthe pacing is terrible in this game its given that when making an open world experience your going to have grindingover leveling problem but all of fromsofts games have this problem to some extent and none of them allow to basically one shot bosses in later areas of the game it feels terrible and basically ruins the dance that was ds3 and sekiros combat why even make the move sets complex and varied at this point and its not hard to over level i wasnt even trying and i ended killing bosses that looked cool for about two seconds before they died and then the other side of things you have bosses that are overly difficult in that they one shot you instead and i could stomach one shot boss as long as it was fun but this leads into my second problemboss move sets the bosses in this game for the most part are bad they look cool except for the stone dogcat those are just lazy filler boss design the two types of bosses are basically mini bosses which get rehashed over and over again or major bosses that range from good to downright awful an example of good fight would be margot and godrick these bosses are challenging and while i have my issues with them theyre really solid overall pretty much every boss after these two are terrible and im only counting the major bosses that arent duplicated into oblivion radahn was the best out of these but his stupid design ruined it like what is that thing hes riding it looks so dumb it ruined his otherwise decent fight i honestly was laughing at him the whole time and when does the meteor attack your telling took his half starved mangled horse with him really wanted to like that fight another disappointing fight was rennala the build up is there the boss room is really cool and then woosh your out in ankle deep lake and her main attack is summoning enemies youve fought before as ghosts what about malekath which becomes sit there watching him jump around and then run up and hit him when stops moving repeat i really wanted to like these bosses but couldnt considering what we had before like gael pontiff the lothric princes the great ape and genichiro those bosses are in another league compared to elden ring nothing in elden ring comes close and i havent even talked about the duplicate bosses in depth all you need to know is that at the end of every cave every dungeon is just another mini boss that youve fought before like the god skin apostles god help those two are by far the single worst thing that exists in this game besides the stone guard dogs handful mini bosses are only duplicated few times but are so easy they dont justify even existing as boss fight but i played through dark souls 2 and that game the worst boss move sets by far out of the souls series so why did i like that game more then elden ring because elden ring does something i never thought id see from fromsoft under scaling levels like villages even castles i was expecting handcrafted world not repeat villages dungeons and caves with the same bear or guard dog or wolf mini boss at the end the best way to put it is everything is front it looks good from distance but as you get closer the realization hits you theres substance under this epic looking coastline or this larger then life high wall that makes up the capital city dark souls had massive interconnected worlds with levels like the undead village lothric castle in its entirety those where to scale compared to elden rings far smaller far emptier level design populated by you guessed it duplicate bosses my most disappointing moment was when i found the lobster shack i was thinking how cool itd be if i could go inside and there would be an npc i could talk to maybe sight of grace to sit at next to fireplace maybe kitchen with pot in the corner i could loot some lobsters from nope prop house that ive seen bunch of times already depth under scaled the beginning of the game felt allot better in this regard but i think its because everything was fresh and new i think if the game was more purposeful not linear really just everything was placed and created for reason outside of house is needed here or mini boss is needed here so lets just select one from our arsenal and pop it in there yeah lets just throw stone guard dog in that boss room that literally looks exactly the same as all the rest i dont know on one hand the game is one of kind and really gave feeling of what perfect game could be and on the other its painful experience that i wish i never played if you can forgive the lazy level design and the mostly mediocre bossesmaybe you wont mind this game you might even enjoy it but coming off of sekiro and ds3 this is just bad gamejust play those if you havent already anyways if i had to settle on score itd be 510 on average 310 at its worst and 810 for the first tenfifteen hours or so of the game,No recomendado,0,6391,62,Negativo,"['Combate y movimiento', 'Diseño de jefes', 'Gráficos']","['Pacing', 'Diseño de niveles repetitivo', 'Diseño de jefes

heres an interesting ordeal about elden ring the souls formula its very much there entertaining gameplay very much there cool bosses very much there unfortunately for title that really does have all the potential to be the game of the halfdecade it falls short in the qa testing and qol department how let give you list of reasonsfor some reason fromsoft decided that certain things such as having check thatll have the game basically insult you for not closing it correctly was more important than fixing crashes guess what causes that check that makes the game insult you for not closing it correctly crashes guess what elden ring likes to do crashcrashing can also corrupt your savefile and if youre not lucky enough that steam made cloud backup youre permanently screwed over and have to restart from scratch say goodbye to your 100 hour characterdid you know that players can place message at the bottom of ladder and grief you by making it next to impossible to climb they can do that same thing for the top of the ladder i certainly hope you didnt fall down pit in certain mine and were scrambling to try and find way up while giant iron maiden with saws for hands was trying to murder you because youll get to it be unable to climb it and pressing the interact button will just bring up message from some moron that reads try fingers but hole as the giant 10 fullmetal killing machine grabs you from behind and kills you instantly why did they not pick up on this in qa testing again oh by the way youll find this at nearly every ladder where something will be trying to kill you while youre climbing it because people are moronsfall damage is terminally inconsistent there are sections where you can fall ten stories and survive without scratch like in some towers there are others where youll jump off five foot high drop freeze then die upon hitting the groundstutters i run this on computer that could theoretically be taken from nasas server farm and i still get random times where itll freeze for five seconds or drop to 15 frames for several seconds guess when this likes to happen during boss fights and times where things are trying to murder mewere you victim of dark bead mage twinking in ds3 guess what they didnt solve twinking you better be ready to get invaded by glass cannons thatve dedicated their entire build to int for using moonveil or str and arc in order to wield the pair of swords that create an instakilling gravity nuke that an aoe the size of debate hall are you not ready for them guess youre never playing multiplayer then because theyre the most common invader types youll run into and theyre literally everywherelooking for build variety in pvp sorry everyones either using bleed proc weapons or the gravity nuke swords you will occasionally find person with normal build otherwise its going to be pain and suffering all the way down theyre using bleed proc because bleed proc is one of the few ways to compensate for boss absurdity by the wayif youre cooping with buddies whatsoever youre agreeing to being invaded and as you may see from the they didnt fix twinking up above take my advice you should get to the next boss fight fast because every second you linger is second closer to another glass cannon invading and oneshotting you and your friendsthe grind to level up is horrendous after you clear level 30 hope youre alright with having to farm in excess of 10000 runes for single level and losing all of them to an invader or an enemy or boss you werent ready for by the way theres guy in certain castle thatll just straight up steal massive chunk of your runes every time you die and you have to kill him to make it stop does the game tell you this soeven if you get them back youre losing progress also hes apparently bugged to the point where his rune stealing will happen anywhere you die on the map have fun with thatalso on the topic of the grind looking to play legitimately sucks to be you pal youre going to be getting invaded by glass cannons twinks and people who are nonstop running rune farms left right and centerwhich means youll have to run rune farms to stay competitive which means youll be spending more time farming than actually playing the gameexpecting bosses that have attack patterns that make sense sorry one of the first ones you fight is literally twelve foot tall guy with superheavy attacks that moves like ballerina and wont stop out or hesitating on his attacks which makes learning his patterns infuriatingly difficult this will happen lotthere are multiple spots in the world where youll just be minding your business and fromsoft will happily drop an enemy far beyond your level and equipment rating atop you as bossget ready for lot of its about skill not gear while youre fighting enemies with an instantly casting hitscan spell that drives your character to madness and kills them instantly also get ready for deathblight thing that exists solely to kill you instantly and all the people running deathblight invasion builds for this exact reasonreally people are incredibly fond of saying skill issue when fromsoft casually drops what is effectively an ancient deity of chaos and madness on you in the overworld when youre sixty levels below where you should be to fight itby the way on the topic of that skill issue heavily upgraded regular sword can take upwards of 50 successful hits to kill the first major boss while slightly upgraded katana can do it in around ten swings and two bleed procs still about skill it never was equip bleed and watch quarter of the health of boss or 34ths the health of pvp invader vanish once that procsits great game with plenty of merit clearly it something to it because ive played 43 hours at the moment of writing this review and im still coming back but the problem is that there is so much rough around the edges missed bugfixing worn spots that need polish and rust that needs to be buffered out which fromsoft have either accidentally or willfully overlooked maybe youll take it like everybody else and say its your game of the year i have to disagree im having fun playing it but that fun is directly tied to whether or not and my friends can go 30 seconds without being invaded by another moonveil twink who found the most optimal route to instantly kill three people with one use of its special attack the second they exit bonfire range,No recomendado,0,6371,63,Negativo,"['Entretenido gameplay', 'Jefes interesantes']","['Problemas de QA y QoL', 'Crashes frecuentes', 'Corrupción de archivos de

ill start off by saying this that this is good game its definitely not how some people describe it to be people that think its the endallbeall of games but its not bad however i do have some things i want to say about it some good and some bad also spoilers if you care about that1i think that the ability to get extremely far in terms of flasksgeneral items and areas located is amazing you dont even have to beat single boss and youd be able to make it extremely far in the game you can get good number of healing flasks and make those flasks heal good chunk of health before you even go past the first choke point area stormveil castle2a lot of weapons and lot of good weapons however one problem i have with this game and the dark souls games specifically dark souls 3 idea about 1 or 2 is that some weapons are very cool to use however by the time youre in late game theyre obsolete because of bad scaling yes you can make them scale better with specific stats however certain special weapons can anot be buffed with incantations to be fair some dont need to be and bnot be infused with new ashes so theyre never able to scale better with 1 stat over the other for instance the dragon kings cragblade is really cool weapon that i really like but it b scaling in dex at the highest now another weapon like the bloodhounds fang is also only b scaling in dex at highest but it can be infused with incantations whereas the cragblade can not meaning its damage ultimate becomes lacking against most enemies it does have 1530 damage bonus to ancient dragons and dragons respectively and the cragblade at 10 base damage of 225 whereas bloodhound fang at 10 is base damage of 345 along with having bleed buildup and better strength scaling than the cragblade cragblade 10 is d for strength and bloodhound fang 10 is c for strength meaning if youre using strength for bestial incantations you can also use bloodhound fang and get bit of extra damage3the bosses are fairly fun to fight up till certain point because late game main story bosses deal an absurd amount of damage when wearing fairly tanky armor crucible axe set taking my main character with 60 vigor i do not have the scarseal or the scorpions on down to around half health with some of their most basic attacks otherwise i think the bosses are good because the fight for lot of bosses is fairly fun bosses like placidusax astel naturalborn and in my opinion most dragon enemies are all fairly fun fights however it is downright criminal the runback for placidusaxs bossfight my god also ill say that gank fights are terrible in this game the valiant gargoyles could be removed from the game and id be more happy than anything else4the areas in this game are fairly well designed and the world isnt filled with stuff but you wont be travelling for too long before finding something else potentially stumbling upon an npc for unique questline or nice little tomb to get spirit ash i wont use cause i have tichemimic19 i think there are some parts of the map that they could have put something more maybe another merchant here or hidden little dungeon there but otherwise the map doesnt feel empty just sometimes it feels lonely5magic is pretty good in this game id say one of the better magic systems ive encountered in game the weapon buffs are fun to use and lot of spells either feel satisfying to use or are just good for clearing out enemies so you like it however i will say that it lacks variety in some departments though ill say i dislike how they basically merged pyromancy and miracles from dark souls to make incantations but its not too big of deal but otherwise for instance you have some types of incantations dragon communioncult tht have around 1312 each respectively and the erdtree incantations with 13 if you combine fire giant and fire monk 13 and then 15 for 2 finger incantations you have quite lot for each however the servants of rot incantations are only numbered as 4 and blood incantations as 4 im not asking to have just arbitrary things fit into having like 15 different rot incantations but for instance you could have an upgrade to pest threads that inflict scarlet rot as debuff or weapon buff to inflict rot since they have poison armament also make the scarlet aeonia not take like 8 seconds to be able to roll away from since even though its really cool its useless in some bossfights compared to either rot dragon heads and the sorceries im fine with there only being like 3 primeval sorceries because theyre supposed to be ancient ones that came before all others makes sense only few of them however i wish that there were some more of the aberrant sorceries for instance or the gravity sorceries for exampleall in all i think this is good game however i dont think people who have been playing fromsoft games for while compare this to something like dark souls its not and its very different from dark souls bosses in dark souls didnt have delayed attacks that were as much as some bosses in elden ring dark souls bosses did have delayed attacks but enough for the player to be able to notice and then dodge and not like in elden ring where you notice and got ta get up and go make sandwich before you come back and dodge and the aspect of the world is very different because dark souls 3 was very linear sure you had some paths you could go on the side for but ultimately you end up on the same path within an hour not like in elden ring where you have the entirety of the haligtree to explore the underground cave areas and most areas that you wouldnt think are optional really are you dont got ta step foot in caelid you can just not use the lift and go the other route and fight the magma wyrm because the world blends fairly nicely sure you end up on the path to the end again but unlike dark souls 3 its not just go hereherehere and youre done and if you cant beat boss then git gud in elden ring its more about you can go herebut theres also here unlocked to you to go to insteadi give elden ring an 8510 its good game its flaws namely in the weaponshow stats work but ultimately is for set of players that enjoy difficult games with refined combat soulslike games with exploration and open worldsi probably have some things i overlooked but if i remember to i might redo this review if and when i remember some things i forgot or

for the first time i am doing revised review for game originally i had given this game negative review because i felt the cons outweighed the pros but after patch 103 and continuing to play the game i feel elden ring deserves revised review which i will be giving it positive score however i do have plenty of cons to mention regardlessgraphicsgame is breathtaking to look at so many moments of wanting to take screenshot and enjoy the scenery of it all even the worst of places in elden ring still looks great and the visuals are top notch out of all the from software games they really made this game incredible on the eyes absolutely jaw dropping to say the leastgameplaysoul games have always been linear and well designed so i was afraid of how from software would handle an open world got ta say they did very excellent job you can pretty much almost go anywhere youd like with few exceptions and elden ring took all previous games before it and placed them all into this one the best traits anyways so much variety of builds to go with lot of ways to fight ashes of war are incredible since they truly spice up combat and the fact you can fight while on horseback is so fun overall also every part of the world is filled with something not single place is empty so many secrets discoveries unique bosses and hidden lore that it is brimming im very impressed to say the leastalso which ever employee came up with spirit summons give them raise theyre super fun concept and the best solution if you somehow cant or unwilling to play online fantastic concept and well executed for suredifficultyits souls like it is going to be hard while i would even say elden ring is the hardest souls yet the devs have given people so many ways in approaching fight the game rewards players for exploring getting stronger finding better weapons or loot and coming back to boss to overcome it while some builds are far superior depending on what you optimize every build is good enough and so long as youre experienced and patient the game can be beaten even with lvl 1 character its all about how you go about fight and learn from your mistakesnpcs and questsperhaps the most depth of any previous souls game as well since theres so many npcs to interact with telling story having quests and these ones actually move around the world which impacts the story some will be more of fan favorite than others but each npc is well written and i definitely loved their dynamics including the fact some outright help you in fights you would of otherwise struggled with doing and completing their quest lines not only rewards you with loot but can even lead to changes and some secrets that wouldnt be possible otherwiseconsso despite elden ring is very good game great even there are lot of issues i have with the game even after patch 103 which fixed or improved the problems i had beforehandvaguenessto explain the game gives little to hints on how to progress certain npc quests what theyll do next where to go at times apart from main mandatory bosses key items very essential items and so forth i understand souls games in the past have held back secrets but because they were linear it was easy to check every corner and not miss too much here the game is open world and the devs went out of their way to hide lot of stuff to the point you will need guide or go into ng while i get they want you to replay their game and invest it isnt properly executed i know fans will say it rewards players for discovering stuff on their own but the fact theres quest markers completion entries or anything to let you know whos gone where it takes out of the game by lot since i hate missing stuffmultiplayerso this is big one i cant seem to coop with friends much at all i can help strangers but if i use password game often disconnects or downright crashes then you have people who are cheating often in pvp using the most meta stuff that makes you die instantly bleed builds and honestly it doesnt feel like the devs balanced it well at all the game is amazing in pve but pvp very unstable and not exactly good only plus side is helping those struggling with boss but thats if the game lets do so other game in my library this issue with doing multiplayercrashes and stuttersgame will at times crash or stutter hard it is at random and nothing fixes it i am not too upset due to the fact it isnt often but when it does happen it is quite terrible to experience my graphics card is up to date newer version and again other game in my library besides infamous skyrim this problem i personally think they need to do more patches to fix this since so many are facing this issue stillmetathis game is obsessed with certain builds as theyre very strong and can make the fight trivial even if you do bleed build or hyper magic build you will destroy both pve and pvp if you do strength build you are hindering yourself sadly as so many enemies are fast hit harder and can tank against your heavy hits also some ashes of war are outright broken also the meta for this game is very off putting rather than earning your stuff you can easily run around collecting upgrades and get your weapon to 9 or even 10 before killing single boss i know you dont have to do this but knowing its possible makes wonder why handicap myself and struggle when i can just be overpowered off the start id rather struggle and be forced to like previous games even if there was cheeselike methods this game too many opportunities to make you feel you need to be meta to just keep up in pve and pvpconclusiongame is great very good i would say lot of downsides with mostly it hiding important information and key items from you forcing you to scout and possibly become overpowered to just win early not exactly the best but for those who like to do whatever it does benefit those people since they can just get to level 45 10 weapon before fighting the first boss after the tutorial boss games balance is questionable and lot of issues with multiplayer with meta and disconnections crashes but otherwise game is very fun engaging so much content awesome bosses and so much variety to the builds if you dont want to be meta i am giving this positive score but it was close to still being negative like the first review i didstill hoping dlc comes out for this game im waiting with baited

ill preface this by saying the game is great for an rpg it the difficulty and mechanics of souls game with immense world building and great story boss design however this game been so heavily praised that everyone is turning blind eye to the very apparent issues that plague not only this game but many fromsoft games in general its sad that after numerous titles these issues still go unaddressed and at the time of editing this review nearly year after the initial release the aforementioned bugs still havent been fixedrepetitivenesselden ring an expansive openworld map that the player can traverse across without any sense of linearity however there are not nearly enough unique enemies to justify such large map what were left with are numerous caverns and dungeons with literal copy paste bosses or slight variants many times over other games do this but not to the extent that elden ring doesjust discovered dungeon and beat the watchdog at the end of it expect to face that exact same boss another 4 times throughout the game on top of this the devs somehow think more is better as if ds2 wasnt heavily criticized for its disgusting spam of enemies if you explore dungeon in late game area where they want to reuse one of the previous field bosses have fun dealing with 2 or sometimes even 34 instances of that same boss this is most egregious when you go to ashen capital and encounter three ulcerated tree spirits all stuck in the same sand pit guarding single talismanits to be expected that with 51 caves and dungeons some boss designs will be reused however literally copy pasting the same enemy and then sometimes adding another 1 or 2 of it to up the difficulty is lazy if you have to do this to fill in the empty space the map shouldnt have been this big to begin withpvpthe pvp in this game feels quite good apart from the atrocious network connections however the devs have taken back step away from balancing weapons with pvp in mind what youre left with is game where only some weapons are viable while others are nearly unusable this was especially apparent on release where every other pvp match was person using the same 2 weapons to gank their way to victory the devs have since nerfed them however this still leaves plenty of others that are either too strong or not usable this is what happens when pvp isnt the main focus and the devs just dont care enough to try and fix it at the risk of changing the balance of pvefor example bloodhound step is so stupidly broken in pvp due to its low cost and infinite iframes its great to use in pve but completely ruins pvp there are many more instances of thisand this isnt even getting into the unaddressed problems with the world map and pvp such as afk farming where host gets to an unreachable spot with horse only to then use taunters tongue to bring people to their world and bm or go afk to farm runes due to invaders having to leave in order to continue playing the gameits apparent the devs just dont care that much that they added it so they could check it off list despite invasions being core mechanic for every souls game by fromsoftbugsloading screens just freeze explanation as to why or what the cause may be it just randomly happens and requires altf4 to fixpc still performance issues with shaders for many players including myself despite said players more than meeting the minimum requirements they supposedly posted an update month or two after release that was supposed to fix this however it not changed it in the slightest for im stuck playing the game at whopping 2030 fps in most areas even though im running gtx1080 mouse cursor constantly leaves the monitor if youre using more than 1 monitor which happens after you exit ui you have to deliberately click on the screen after exiting the ui in order to refocus the game i have never had this issue with any other game before only elden ringkeybindings are trash and its enraging they still treat pc players like 2nd rate users after decades of development on souls games this is the 7th souls game and they still produce subpar controls for pc its just downright insulting for aaa studio to be doing this and people who can only respond with well dont play on kbm its supposed to be played with controller only further prove my point if youre going to have support for it dont half ass it if the only excuse people can give is well dont use that feature then that feature is not good all ui prompts are defaulted to controller meaning when you first start playing the game you have way of knowing what keybinds are what hell it took 30 minutes of guessing what keys to press and having to alt f4 when getting stuck in some menu due to not knowing what the back button is to finally navigate to the keybindings menu to change and save to my own preferences i mean seriously the default key binds for ui dont even make sense instead of having the primary or secondary keybinds for navigating back in ui menus be escape backspace or even delete they chose q mappings for specific actions are forcibly grouped together meaning you can not have separate inputs eg sprint roll and back step have to come from the same key this would be fine if they were in different contexts but they arent youre forced to abide by the small amount of options that come from using controller despite not actually using controller inputs are noticeably delayed ingame id wager this is due to the game being designed around controller gameplay requiring it to delay the action in order to check for additional inputs for combined keybinds or double clicking another example of fromsoft just not giving any attention or care to their pc audience on top of the previous complaints they hardcoded specific keys which can not be changed from the keybindings menu just why it isnt even cherry picking all ui keys are hardcoded meaning im stuck with the default q for navigating backwards again lazyin conclusionelden ring is the perfect example of game whose devs could not keep up with the designers the result when you take great world design engaging combat and incredibly unique story bosses while simultaneously cutting corners in almost every aspect in order to meet the massive scale of the game is the game good yea its really fun are there tons of hours worth of play time definitelyis it perfect absolutely not,No

it presents and shows us with amazing reflections and lights illuminating the city giving life to it is brought down by the gameplay and the way the systems are designedto illustrate this the perk system is based on bonuses such as deal 10 more damage with light machine guns or reload 5 faster and those are boring upgrades to attain while playing we as players want to do crazy stuff meaningful stuff and to see most upgrades just be bonuses leaves feeling of desiring something more i would have preferred being able to soak up the damage by using steel arm or slowing time in gunfights rather than the skills we got while there are mechanical upgrades these tend to be few and are insignificant as well half the timehttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2325343689gunplay is also sort of clunky giving sensation of being dull and slow while integrating numbers into the mix that adds more into an already heavily packed hud you aim and shoot while getting to cover and playing

first off i didnt watch any of the preview trailers i didnt know what was going on with cyberpunk i had assumed cdpr dumpstered it when i heard it droppedmy curiousity got the best of this is your last warning to avoid any spoilersits been yeara few patches laterand 25 playthroughs and i can review itnoi dont reccomend it why dont i reccomend it theres so many reasons why i dont but lets start off the good stuffthe city looks great the music is killer the concept is cool the characters you interact with are generally interesting in some wayfixers aside and thats about where my praise stops youll see praise about the graphics and storyyoull see people sing praise about how cdpr fixed problems and will keep fixing problemsabout how we got some dlcsand none of that matters not one bit of it the core problems of the game are not fixed theres issues with the game that go down to the foundation and spit polishing the rest of the decrepit structure doesnt solve the foundations collapse lets start off with the story life paths generally mean nothing in the grand scheme of things it changes your first hour or soand it changes how you can interact with certain charactersbut beyond thatit matters not life paths werent expanded on by cdpr so i wont go further into themthe story pacing is all kinds of justbad the life path is 15m to an hour depending on if you actually want it to drag on longer then begins act 1 act 1 is just terribly paced the montage is gameplay we shouldve gottento build up with jackie the game wants us to care about jackieand triesbut it falls flat on its face during act 1 you meet lot of interesting characterstalk lotand plan the biggest heist in the city its all cool and payday like in some ways but theres crackssmall onesthat start to show here you get introduced to all these peopleand are given so little reason to care about them or their problems act 2 suffers more of the samebut we get johnny johnnys actually pretty cool guy in my opinion i was always mostly entertained by his appearencesand quips in conversations or hearing is input on whats going on sure hes disembodied voice in my headbut at least hes funny at times act 2 picks up where act 1 endsyou have hole in the headand youre dying because johnnys eating your brain meat theres high points in act 2 the vas did great work here trying to convey emotion and the troubling times vikvand other characters do amazing work here act 3 is figuring out what to doand exploring johnny and the end game and the 3 paths you have laid out in front of you help with that final choice seeing johnny change from hardcore anti corpo jerkoff to becoming more mellow after sees the damage hes done to vand others around themalong with how the world didnt changewakes him up its an interesting change of character and shows that johnny could grow its shame that v didnt really grow as much as i hoped would the endings are all well doneand all interesting in their own ways depending on what you choose to do i wont spoil thembut i did quite like them but the stories alrightits got pacing issues for the first half of the game the side gigs are where the good writing really shows through theres lot of very good onesand lot of very enjoyable ones that i quite enjoyed beyond the pacing problems i didnt have an issue with the story for the most parti just wish that the writers took more into account of if v was his own character or the player it feels like at times they forgotso the stories passable the voice acting is very well doneso why am i thumbing it downmechanicallythe game isnt fun thats my biggest problem with the game mechanicallyits not fun at all its boring slog while yesyou can do crazy buildsthose crazy builds dont mean whole lot when you realize that the perks are all almost all passive bonuses like added damage or higher crit chance the game uses terrible looter shooter systemand theres just not enough gear to justify it some weapons have plenty of time in the limelightothers not so much the armor system is cancer and you look like you went dumpster diving in the trash wall outside the city most of the gear you find will be broken down into parts to upgrade the gear you actually like most of the gear wont ever be touched because it conflicts too much with your build the builds just arent fun nor are they intuitive most of the perks are passive perks that increase critical damage or critcal changeor outright damage most of the perks you want for build will end up conflicting with other things you want in build but once you realize that all builds pale in comparison to the sneaky hackerman revovler build that clears entire compounds in seconds with spreading quickhacksyou learn that most build crafting is utterly pointless you dont even

good railroad story game not so great rpg there will be appropriately tagged spoilers for the ending because for the ending is easily where the game falls apart so i need to address it however dont shy away immediately as some of the ending criticisms are spoiler freefor starters i would personally rate the game as 610 or 710im not joking when i say i would still recommend game that i believe is 610 and this is because overall cyberpunk 2077 is good game my main issue with it is that it is not what i was expecting i wasnt expecting better game but rather different gameanother quick point is that although i have 56 hours in game most of this was leaving my pc on overnight i reached the endgame having done the main quest and side quests with actual story in about 30 hours the pros 1 the world itself for this game is fantastic the dystopian architecture is outstanding i like the clear differences between vibrant night city and the desolate badlands2 adding onto the above is the world building everything that adds life to the city the cars the people the clothing the flashing lights and the advertisements they all fit quite neatly and look great3 the characters in this game are solid too the two that stand out for the most are jackie and judy these two characters in particular are moulded in such way that it genuinely feels like there is relationship between these characters and v even for male v in judys case4 the rpg elements within the game are apparent theyre used frequently to access new dialogue options sometimes ways to finish quest but mostly to open doors but even then it just feels like youve made good build however they arent flawless the cons 1 first up the bugs some of them feel like really simple bugs sometimes theyre game breaking i play bethesda games so im used to bugs but theyre worth pointing out in any review2 the police and crime systems are completely whack when you commit crime you can physically see the police spawn in around you but they dont chase you you can tear off in car and lose 4star rating after driving one or two blocks it just feels like pointless system also you can literally swipe everything not nailed down without consequence3 the driving is something horrific generally the cars feel really floaty and slightly tapping or d will usually send you veering off into poor crowd of civvies bikes handle much better but in comparison to the cars they feel like dead weight not floaty enough plus collisions are nightmare slight tap with some vehicles seems to send you flying all over the place and its just tiring to deal with4 the gunplay feels bit clunky to again ive played the older bethesda fallout games so im used to it but it just simply felt like i couldnt keep up with the ai and it didnt feel like sensitivity issue because my sensitivity felt fine outside of combat add to that guns that just feel really weak in general and youve got system that definitely needs revisiting5 the rpg elements they exist and they allow you to play role yes but its simply astounding just how irrelevant they feel to the actual game there are very few choices i can recall and none of them really bring to mind any particular consequences at any point throughout the game6 the 5050 approach to sandbox cyberpunk is strange in that the world is so beautifully crafted it makes you want to explore however theres nothing to actually do when you do explore there are the gigs but theyre so mindnumbingly dull that they dont feel worth dedicating time to one gig had go into basement and turn on some lights for some eddies7 this sort of ties in with the above but there were very few side quests that were story oriented in my opinion for an openworld rpg i feel like i shouldnt be finishing the game within 30 hours im spoiled by the elder scrolls and fallout even cdprs the witcher games in that i want to have games that i can sink days into at time and still not have finished the few storyoriented side quests contained within are great there just isnt enough of them8 the overall tone of the story i dont feel like im spoiling anything here really so tag the game the player constantly feel like theres sense of rush sense of urgency this leaves the player feeling like theres very little freedom to go and explore this is exacerbated by the fact that even some of the side quests remind you of this overall rushthis shows that the game prioritises its story above all else and this ultimately means is that this isnt cyberpunk the rpg its cyberpunk the railroaded action game its story game with rpg elements just slapped on top the ending more cons for it should go without saying that this will be spoiler territory so be warned ill spoiler tag all of it but im separating my ending review into two sections mechanics and content im torn on leaning towards dislike for the ending and i dislike the way it works separating them into two sections allows those who want to see why i criticise the ending to do so without ruining the actual ending itself for themselves1 the mechanicsa the ending you get at the end of the game is completely determined by single choice you make during the final mission technically two choices but that falls under content so i cant say more here this adds on to the point about the lack of true rpg elements and the lack of consequence b theres also endgame content the free roam simply places you prior to the ending of the final mission and this just leaves feeling robbed of true ending 2 the contenta the actual ending itself just feels terrible you spend the entire game trying to get johnny out of your body only to get told v is going to die in 6 months anyway it just makes feel like ive wasted my time everything just feels robbed from b the endings dont leave any room for dlc expansion post game because most involve v leaving nc or dying dlc wont feel like an extension just more side stuff that tonally doesnt feel like you can fit into vs existing story is cyberpunk 2077 good game yes as long as youre looking for storyled game if youre looking for an rpg with freedom akin to bethesda titles or the witcher 3 change those expectations because otherwise youll just end up being disappointed like i was and it will take you time to truly appreciate this game for what it actually is,Recomendado,1,6295,71,Negativo,"['Mundo del juego',

this should make modding more stable as well rain occlusion you dont understand how big of difference this makes now rain wont go through solid objects and roofs alttab actually works now before it just seemed to freeze my game i was sometimes able to get it to work by exiting and reopening and exiting the window but that did not always work alttab works perfectly in draw distances are incredible seeing trees and other objects much further away than i can in the old skyrim they definitely did good here i can even see some buildings that are extremely far away makes for the perfect immersion i also havent seen one flickering object in the background that is not to say there isnt any but i havent seen any which is nothing but good side note with some testing i was able to tweak my draw distances on original skyrim to match those of i can see bleak falls barrow and high hrothgar from whiterun which i dont remember if that was possible before comes with the cost of really bad flickering which can not be fixed that is only fixed in flora amount been greatly improved it makes for great landscape and makes the forests seem more alive cons doesnt seem like they really reworked any of the textures i am still seeing horribly pixilatedblocky textures around skyrim they should not be able to get away with this in their video they say remastered artwork but in reality they upscaled the textures some went from 512 to 1024 but others were probably stretched even further and this degrades quality insanely and degrades performance for quality improvement what the hell were

32 hours of gameplay and its finally over my character is riding shotgun in the scripted scene happy and free as tapeworm the game wants to put in the solemn and sentimental mood which is why it generates another random car in front of ours the characters are throwing it off the road without stopping the conversation id want to say that this is cyberpunk 2077 in nutshell but it really isnt theres nutshell at least not an easily crackable one so lets talk detailsim really glad that steam recommendednot recommended grade instead of the likedislike one cause otherwise i wouldve had significantly more problems with picking the right one cyberpunk 2077 is game videogame that is the one you can pump lot of hours into without regretting it much it falls around the same level as fallout 4 or whatnot game with hookability and not much else the one that can put you in an endless loop of okay one more quest which drags you throughout the entire game without leaving any sort of emotional impact or feeling of satisfaction and theres way more to that than just luckluster storyfirst of all the game is monument to effort oh theres clearly plenty of that the city is vast diverse and yeah sort of beautiful its probably the most technically and aesthetically impressive city since i dont know forever and heres the problem its an exhibition showpiece if you will what i wanted jumping through glass from one penthouse to another fighting on flying platforms between the neon billboards hacking the traffic lights to create chaos on the roads theres nothing like this whatsoever not even in the story missions this city is more than backdrop you spend 90 of your time crawling through the corridors breaking necks or just travelling around through the system of teleportation devices cause thats the treatment you want right night city just ignores you go on run over dozen of pedestrians the cops wont even start chase theyll forget about that once you leave the scene same goes for the gangs not even slaughtering whole squad of yakuzas is going to stop their sama from giving you missions or asking whether or not you want to buy her crappy minicar aside from some scripted encounters and story missions you wont even notice any sort of crime problems within night citys limits gta2 had more consequences for messing with the wrong dojo in fact gta2 did several things better than cyberpunk 2077 for example the radio remember taxi drivers by bula matari theres magic here the music in 2077 is mostly forgettable or downright awfulso yeah have fun i mean this was supposed to be great game right fabulous spectacular grandiose why the hell does it make sneak around with this pathetic skyrimtype stealth system in fact its even worse cause at least in skyrim the enemies arent deaf you can make any sort of sound that is not gunshot right behind their back and they wont notice anything theyll just keep staring at walls allowing you to do your worst also theres difference between just knocking the enemy out or straight up snapping their neck never once any of them woke up the game breaks new grounds really i beat it on very hard difficulty but im pretty sure it wouldnt have made any difference on easy aside from boss fights but theres like five totalbut alright you dont want to sneak around you wan na shoot the bastards in the face then youre stuck with this weird floaty gunfight mechanics bullet sponge enemies and completely useless skill system at some point i just stopped spending points on anything cause it made difference i only spent them if encountered locked dialogue option since youre luckily allowed to open your character screen right in the middle of talking to someone oh sorry did you say something yeah lem just add another point to intelligence so i can answer you in fact i finished the game with 18 points in crafting despite not crafting anything at all simply because it let open locked doors or choose specific dialogue olines that made life easier but if you do want to roleplay as tinker good luck finding any highlevel components in loot buying yeah sure for the price of good car the game gives you all the best gear anyway well best by its standards youre still ought to shoot some enemies in the face about fifteen times before they go down implants i know i know in fact implants are the only reason to spend your levelup points on body that or if you want to steal other peoples cars but i didnt mess with it or with hacking or with weapon stats and again finished the game on very hard without any problemsin certain ways cyberpunk 2077 is metaphor for its own world come for skyscrapers and neon but stay cause youve got shift at burger king this gameplay is so mundane so generic you could splice human revolution and saints row 4 together and this is what youre gon na get and while 2077 is still much better than both of these games combined theres way to make this gameplay appealing im tired of this kind of stealth im tired of this abstract lightblue cyberspace im tired of characters that you know are going to survive cause they give you side quests have mercy once thing is nice though theres difference between not humorous and not funny and thank god cd projekt choose the former for the most part the game takes itself seriously which is almost refreshing well aside from couple of bizarre sidequests with references to pop culture which are so out of place and cringeworthy that it almost makes you nervously chucklewere not gon na talk about all these glitches bugs and just lack of polish hehe polish in general its gon na be fixed some day whats not gon na be fixed is that some people not i never liked the witcher series so i didnt care expected gaming messiah and got just some nice guy instead fine to hang out with not good enough to follow into battle again i want to emphasise its not bad game per its just unoriginal and trite in almost every aspect it property of seventh generation of consoles written all over it which i guess makes sense given the fact that it was announced eight years ago one day people who grew up with it will remember it fondly but there will never come day when this game will count as classics,No recomendado,0,6193,74,Negativo,[],"['Mundano y genérico gameplay', 'Falta de elementos emocionales impactantes', 'Ciudad impresionante pero

apologies for the manifesto thats belowthis is tough onei distinctly remember where i was when cyberpunk 2077 was announced all the way back in middle school and now it released just before i finished university to put it simply cp2077 been long time coming it been said countless times before but i still feel like its important to be seen if you have been eating breathing drinking sleeping about cp2077 and took everything cdpr showed us as gospel you will be disappointed if you thought this game was the return of jesus christ or the cure for cancer or that its release would somehow revert all the misery 2020 seems to infinitely produce you will be disappointed and unfortunately that is your fault for thinking so the game is with some exceptions of course mile wide but an inch deep its also great until it isnt allow to explain that further cp2077 tries incredibly hard to suck you into its world and 9 times out of 10 it truly works in my play time i have never been so sucked into fictional world than cp2077 characters like jackie or panam are incredibly fleshed out their dialogue and scenes with your character are truly some of the best in the industry in those scenes i feel like im there talking to them not v but then that 1 out of 10 times happen perhaps jackie tposes during an incredibly inopportune time or maybe panam just decides to venture off to the shadow realm midconversation leaving you talking to yourself maybe your car will turn into submarine if you hit lamp post and take you under the map at jusssst the right angle its these funny to gamebreaking bugs and glitches that really take you out of the simulation that cdpr tried so hard at creating making you remember that this is just game the map is gorgeous thats undeniable cdpr put lot of detail into night city and its surrounding locales from the immaculate areas where the rich and corporations are situated to the industrial slums that surround it all the way to the grimy oil fields and dirty badlands however its just that there is depth to the map whatsoever cdpr tired to counteract this with side missions gigs and mini missions dressed up as police dispatches they even dressed up car purchases as missions to bloat up the map i managed to complete every mission offered in the game and i have compelling reason to return to the game sadly there are not lot of open buildings you can explore while the map size is generously large the map itself is cut up and gerrymandered in such way that the map size is more of an illusion for example the playable area of the district of pacifica is only half of what the map implies as for graphics i have modest rig with the exception of 2080 and everything ran smoothly on high settings i decided to leave the film grain option on and while that may be controversial move im glad i kept it seeing the grain interact with the night sky and the light pollution remind of movies like driveheatblade runner or my old photos on my film camera perhaps its nostalgia talking but i thought it looked great as for the story i wont reveal much for the sake of people who wish not to be spoiled the first act is definitely the most polished and i wish that it was stretched out this is not to say that the rest of the plot is trash but it is noticeable when cdpr heard feedback from some players say that the story for witcher 3 was too long for them which i think is crazy but i digress they scrambled to trim some fat i also do wish that the missions that dictate your character nomad street corp were longer or more important as at the end of your first mission v will be identical matter what life path you chose for the rest of the game the main side missions were all really well executed most notably panam who id argue is the most fleshed out character after v and silverhand the dialog choices you are presented are more fallout 4 than deus ex the music was really well done the original soundtrack was fantastic the radio stations were good but could get repetitive i for one really enjoyed the jazz station for nice change of pace compared to the other stations that kinda blended into one in my opinion gameplay was fine i used controller for majority of my playthrough and experienced little to issues with input driving was passable but only just i swear that the brakes dont work as intended as i have to brake football field ahead of turn gunplay was fine more cod than typical rpg which im not complaining about the part where i actually say if you should buy the game or not so would i recommend the game thats an incredibly tough question to answer its really all in the mindset of who is purchasing the game if you are someone who had calendar date for the games release bought merch and complained that it got delayed multiple times i would not purchase it lets be honest here you already did buy it if you were expecting this game to be such technological marvel and game changer that keanu reeves himself comes out of your monitor and give you huge kiss on the lips and tuck you into your bed every night i would not purchase it if you were someone who was interested in the game but didnt fall for the hype train i would wait for this game to go on sale you are not missing out on anything important personally i bought this game because i had deus ex itch that needed to be scratched and it did it similarities to deus ex but is also separate enough to be somewhat fresh breath of air for if the devs at eidos are peeking around the level design and story of mankind dividedhuman revolution and the controlcombat of cp2077 would be fantastic so if youre in the same boat as i was and craving some more jc or adam jensen action this is the next best thing but wait for sale if you want to purchase this game at its current state i strongly advise you wait for decent sale only if cdpr make some drastic improvements and quality of life would i recommend this game at full price its shame as i was excited to play the game and while i did enjoy my playthrough i was left with hallow taste in my mouth this game needed to have been delayed by full year at minimum i hope this was helpful,No

coming up on 300 hours of play and beating the game multiple times in market where games keep releasing unfinished or stay in alphabeta forever this game had the best release i can remember people like to compare elden ring to darksouls 3 which is pretty accurate darksouls 3 was one of my favorite games of all time and elden ring does it quite bit better lets start off by talking about the strengths of elden ringthe massive world elden rings world is huge maybe too big you see mountain in the distance you can climb that mountain you climbed that mountain and now see castle or ruins in the distance you can explore that area too the thing about ds3 after thousands of hours played the levels start to seem very small i dont think this will ever be the feeling elden ring players will encounter the map is also very detailed and enjoyable to look at and make markers forcharacter creation1010 its amazing since it so many settings to play with you can also change your appearance and name later in the game one of the best character creators i have had time to tinker with if you tried you could probably make your character look like your real life avatar the graphics and optimization er many settings to be tweaked and seems to do good job running on older machines some of the game does have some optimization issues but they are resolved and unnoticeable for the most part the graphics on highmaximum are pretty amazing for the scale of the game might not be as good as demon souls remake quality but then again the world is massive and something had to give the art is amazing new weapons skills and tilesets of course they reuse many things from the old souls games which is actually smart considering the scale of the game if you consider all the new art they added the reuse of old material is welcomed by myselfthe music and sound for the game are next level i actually feel myself being unnerved by some areas music so much so i am hesitant to go back and find items in that location i play ton of games like escape from tarkov or warzone so i know about bad sound lol the developers will put sound cues on many important items like scarabs these sounds work well for training players who want to discover secret areas to listen to less prominent noisescrafting is new mechanic to the game and is done very well the game is huge and being able to interact with the environment through harvesting definitely makes it slightly more immersive the crafting motivates players to look all around hoping to find an ingredient for cure poison or scarlet rott coupled with the ability to make detailed markers on the map you can set up some useful crafting routes ui and controls can be finicky especially if you are new to the genre i am glad they kept the same as the past titles but some other people will not like the double bound controls personally i am use to this departmentthe multiplayer this is where er could shine quite bit more er decoupled summoning players and the stat boost from the effigyarc rune i think this is good idea the game is meant to be played with others which is why they added ash summoning ashs can be very strong sometimes better than co operator great addition but what is really disappointing is the 4 player maximum count ds3 you could get up to 7 players in your game this was great for fightclubs or just playing the game and being invaded i understand the decision to reduce to 4 maximum players was probably made because of network instability even with 4 players its unstable i know they are working hard to resolve this and have talked about it openly this is not the only problem though there is also multiplayer pvp arenas like ds3 and ds2 this is kind of mind blowing considering how many arenas you come accross i am hoping this is resolved through dlc kinda like they did for ds2 the mutiplayer some weird hitches people dont understand as well you cant summon co operator with duelist in your world you cant summon duelist if you are invaded you can summon co operator then duelist and then be invaded however the sequencing for who enters the world of the host is very important 2 players can not connect to host world at the same time this is problematic since invasions are out of the hosts control and sometimes occur at the same time as host trying to summon player which results in unable to summon or disconnect once the disconnect occurs there is also cool down before summon signs will appear again once i figured out how it works i resolved 95 of the disconnection issuesbalance is another controversial er topic there are few builds which are abusing some mechanics that make pvp not so great fires deadly incantation is mostly the root of these problems but some other builds using blood hound dodge can also be very frustrating to fight against i am sure fromsoftware will fix it but its still something that needs to be talked about if you are trying to duel and use reasonable build around sl 130 you will probably be disappointed with the results i am not saying its impossible to have good fights but the chance you go against great oak shield or eclipse shotel is high dont even get started on moonveil katana and bloodhound step users though xdconclusionall in all the game is not far from perfect in my eyes the game just released and it was near perfect release from my experience the balance will get ironed out so points deducted to my score for the game in that area i do have to deduct some points for the multiplayer i am sure these issues will also be resolved or lessened when the community learns how to do the workarounds relative to other game releases for the past few years i think 95 is fair score its almost perfect and soon with patch or 2 or dlc it will be there very rarely do we get to experience work of art like this game i do recommend trying to play without wiki or guides but more so use them as tool to point you in the right direction this game is so full of wonder and mystery most the enjoyment is just discovery or being awe inspired by the view of an area thats new huge and you get to explore9510 best release i can

okay let begin by saying that i did not have any hype for cyberpunk 2077 when it launched i didnt start hearing about it until all the keanu reeves city to burn memes started popping up and i thought that it looked interesting but not enough to spend 60 on i hate buying video games but have spent 1000 on apex free game btw and i definitely wasnt going to preorder it december 2020 came and we can unanimously agree that this game had godawful launch but regardless i put it on my wish list and didnt think about it againfast forward to march of 2022 ive just bought my first gaming pc and i see cyberpunk is on sale and i think hey this game looks pretty cool and its been over year all the bugs have got to be fixed by now right well i can confidently say that i was incorrect cyberpunk 2077 is still buggy game but nowhere near as buggy as it was on launch its bit frustrating that some of these bugs have been in the game since day one but not as frustrating as dumping half an r301 mag into gibraltar and doing six damage because noregs and respawn entertainment servers say screw you very frustrating look ive played good games and ive played bad buggy nightmares and i can tell you that the bugs in this game arent that bad the bugs in cyberpunk while noticeable dont seriously detract from the enjoyment yeah some dude is gon na be sitting on air and maybe another chicks gun is gon na stick to her hand while shes on the phone but none of that matters if im staring at panams dumpy is it immersionbreaking yeah little and that sucks next i wan na talk about the combat i had been playing on mouse and keyboard for literally less than two weeks and i decided to play this game on its secondhardest difficulty hard which this game is anything but seriously this game is easy the prologue is crazy stupid easy afterwards theres massive difficulty spike that makes you go oh damn challenge please say challawnge in your head okay ily ty but then you realize you just got ta make nicheish build and grind for little to time and badabing badaboom done i finished the game at character level 43 and with level 50 street cred i think 50 is max for both but defo is for sc with blunt melee focused build that i abandoned because arm swords are coollooking some guns are bit floaty but most have the right weight to them especially snipers you can walk around straight up one or twoshotting enemies not bosses but theyre still easy to beat all the challenge comes from realizing that matter how high your level is enemies can also one or twoshot you and they will its dumb however so are the enemies as i said i was focused on blunt melee for while so i was just running around punching fools like i just dropped fragment east and i landed on standard stock and eight enemies that means lot of punching and running away except in this game im winning i get the drop on them i stun lock them they donezo ez clap ggs git gud hardstuck trash score one cyberpunk over apex the world of night city or i guess city of night city is beautiful one i think cyberpunk 2077 does an excellent job at depicting its different subsets not just between the open desert and the city as whole but within the city itself theres clear difference in the wealthier sides of town the slums the gaudy tourist attractions and my personal favorite sexy sex time avenue what i play apex legends im virgin all jokes aside theres lot of sexual stuff in this game pretty much every ad is sexual or violent in some way or another and theres lot of ads theres an entire tv channel dedicated to the ads its funny and great for worldbuilding something something hypercapitalism something but dang im not trying to see an ad for watson every time i wan na go up the elevator to my apartment i mean not unless i can actually watch the show which i canti dont think can iby far the best thing about cyberpunk is its story story is my main focus in game like this and here it truly is something special however thats primarily because of the charactersthe story itself is good but somewhat yeah okay when can i shoot things this allows the side missions cast to shine some games i feel like the characters are so bland and soulless that i have to force myself to beat it thats not the case with cyberpunk every main character is wellrounded person especially panam that helps to fully realize the story completing the game without finishing numerous side missions is just setting yourself up for disappointment i wont tell anyone how to play but ive always found that immersing myself in games world and its people will always lead to the most enjoyable experience you even get more endings unlocked by forming connections with the characters obligatory apex jokeultimately i did really really enjoy this game i dont think ive said anything new there is to say about it and thats okay im gon na play it again i only played through it once and i havent searched anything about the other endings so im excited to play through it again with fresh outlook games like people are imperfect some are good some are apex legends but theres something beautiful about good game that makes you overlook its imperfections i believe cyberpunk that somethingtldr cyberpunk 2077 is good game buy it on sale 48 or lesssome quick things that i didnt know how to fit into the above and ive already written legit

as many other people have pointed out there are lot of bugs at this stage of the game this is to be expected the game is really huge in scope and theres bound to be bugs in release software is never finished only released this is not huge issue for as im writing this review 2 days after release theyll iron out most of the bugs i encountered in my playthroughi didnt have any major performance issues while playing with ryzen 5 3600 and rtx 2060 super i had rtx enabled and the game looked dropdead gorgeous they definitely nailed the visual aspect of the game the city the characters and the overall atmoshpere looks amazing and its obvious they wanted the game to look as edgy as possible which is good thing for cyberpunk game they definitely nailed this part of the game i was not really able to experience much of the audio of the game because of my setup but the only concern i had with audio was due to bugs again something that will probably be fixed later onat first i did not really care about the characters and story maybe because i wasnt attentive but i also played the witcher 3 game by the same developers and game that i think had much more engaging story than this game this may be because they wanted this game to be more open ended as it was more on this later supposed to be an rpg and to be fair i did start liking the story after while although still not really stoked about it i only managed to get one ending as of writing this and ill be playing bit more to get the other ones as well i do have gripe with starting paths though they dont influence much of anything in the story its just there to say something different depending on your path it doesnt really add anythingup to this point everything ive talked about are minor flaws in my opinion bugs are to be expected and i did not purchase the game for its story but rather for the replayability and the customizability of the game ive been dreaming of different character builds and cool outfits and custom cars and random events id participate in and this is the main reason why i dont recommend anyone buy the game at its current stage none of the things i mentioned are in the game sure you can buy clothing and sure you can spec into skills and make different builds but it becomes painstakingly obvious that these are lacking lot there are not nearly as much customizability that we were lead to believe there were you cant even preview clothes when buying to see how they look on you you cant customize cars and given enough specs into strength you dont even need to buy most of the cars as you can just steal one from the streets almost none of the cool edgy things that were in the night city wire trailers actually accessible to you even though some of it is in the game i wanted my character to look like those mox guards and clearly as they are in the game the game assets are in the game but as there is way to modify your character once youve started the game in terms of appearance separate from clothing you got choicethis issue would have been kind of passable had there been good character customization screen so that you would be satisfied to continue with what you got but not even that is possible the character creation screen is lackluster it does not have nearly enough of the complexity of good character screen for example something like what the sims sliders body build modification none of that cool half skin half metal body parts you only have couple of piercings and some hairstyles how can any of these features be missing from an rpgwell the thing is cyberpunk 2077 is not an rpg at least the description box never mentions it is an rpg instead it says that it is an actionadventure story they slowly shifted from an rpg to an action adventure and removed lot of features in the meantime but this is most definitely not the fault of the developers the designers or people who worked on the game its got more to do with the people related to the business side of things they already delayed the game 3 times already to rush the game development to fit the deadline they had their developers crunch for the game for almost at least counting the delays they were probably crunching for whole lot more year most of the stuff that they showed in their trailers and gameplay demos are either gone misleading or downright untrue because they probably didnt have enough time to add into the game its easy to act as if youre progressive company and pander to audiences mistreating your employees and pushing out content unfinished just for money is just downright low maybe cdpr could learn from their game and not be like the corporations they depict but by that argument i guess that would make rockerboy for saying this stuff im not sure how to format the review so ill add any other miscellaneous problems into this paragraph please note that these are not gamebreaking by any means its just that these are minor inconveniences that bugged bit while playing ill make sure to get back to add more as i remember them stealth is not that fun you dont have chance with silenced weapons as you cant oneshot almost anyone while sneaking around without specing into lot of stats which is not worth the effort as you can just approach someone and do takedown which is very limited and gets boring very quick as there are 2 animations for takedowns and you cant takedown anyone with melee weapons which would have been really cool furthermore the doubletap dash mechanics screws your run up sometimes the vehicles are too responsive sometimes its as if theyve never ridden vehicle before its as if the vehicles were moving on ice or something the one hacking minigame is fun but it would have been nice to see some variety you can only create hex strings for so longtldr the game many bugs and missing features in its current state it lacks lot of promised features most probably because of crunch and trying to fit the release into deadline i am fan of cdpr and i do like the game or at least what they meant it to be but this sort of actions are not the way to go fix your game and treat your devs right,No

summarycyberpunk 2077 is game that can become whatever you want it to be with so many choices and playstyles those of you thinking this is futuristic gta might be disappointed but make mistake this game is just as big and diverse cyberpunk brings the rpg genre ahead once again with so many choices that can affect how people interact with you it creates sense of realism as if you are actually living in night city i feel with these types of games the main story isnt the only thing that defines game its also the side quests and atmosphere this game doesnt fail to disappoint with hours of content outside of the main story allowing you to lose yourself within the game and fade into the life of v not only that but the choices you make in these side missions can play part in the main story those stories can be emotional funny dark exciting and sometimes all of those things at once which only adds to the depth of cyberpunk and making you more invested in the charactershowever the game isnt perfect the number of bugs in the game currently takes you out of the immersion by making key choices seem like joke or hassle not to mention random gameplay issues that force you to reload saves just to fix quest objective then there is the poor optimisation for most older computers though what do people expect on outdated hardware due to cdpr being the developers i have doubt these things will be squashed out within the next few months making the game one of the most iconic and legendary games to come out of 2020 if not the decade prosconsgreat story with multiple optionsimpactful decisionsbeautiful and atmosphericamazing soundtracksgood voice actingnarrationunlimited replayabilitytedious at timeslots of bugsbad performance on lower end cardsunderutilized mechanics my experiencealthough i would say the game was overhyped for most people it still fell well within my expectations i do agree that the number of bugs should have been flushed out before release but with the game being as hyped as it was i dont think they could delay it any further without more backlash however by means is this bad game due to that fact although the bugs may take you out of the immersion from time to time the overall story and structure of the game is simply breathtakingyou are quickly thrown into one of three life paths giving you unique playthrough along with lengthy prologue to give you feel for the game and set the foundations for the overall story one of the best parts of the game is your relationship with johnny frequently gives you his input and acts as moral compass although his morals may not be right gives you another perspective on events that you would otherwise pass off as normal discussion this not only makes you question your own thinking process but also if johnny is being over the top or being realistic it gives added depth to what should be the simple choicesthe game really emphasis your decision making and your willingness to do side missions not only does it change the flow of the story but also changes how characters interact with you allowing level of immersion seen in few gameshowever the ncpd tasks are tedious at times with lot of them feeling like typical go here kill few people and retrieve the item to complete the objective if they didnt present an opportunity to give you cash and increase your street cred i really wouldnt have bothered with them as much as i didafter completing everything the game to offer and doing all the endings i can safely say that this is an rpg through and through all your choices matter even the ones you think wont im already planning on doing another play through but with heavily different choices to see how different character react and develop along with the story there is never dull moment in night city from the bizarre side missions amazing storyline to the wonderful and gorgeous visuals it sucks you in like other game in recent memory the photo mode is also fantastic allowing you take some breathtaking screenshotsimportant questionswould i recommend this game to friend yesshould i buy it for the full price yes unless you have an older computer though id still recommend getting it and giving it go you can always refund if it doesnt run well how long is the game if you do everything the game to offer its easily over 50 hours however just less than 20 hours if you only do the main storylinehow are the controlsthey are good and well thought out everything is simple to figure out and what you would expect from first person rpghow is combati hated the gunplay when i first started playing but as you level up your skills with these weapons they become far easier to use and become really fun plenty of options for what type of combat you want to do allowing you to enjoy multiple playstylesreplayabilityunlimited with different choices and different playstyles there are so many different outcomes to even the smallest of missionsmy final thoughtsif you are person that loves singleplayer storytelling and likes the freedom of choice you wont be disappointed cyberpunk 2077 throws you into one of the most beautiful cities in gaming with very few restrictions in what you can and cant do in night city offering hundreds of different choices on how to make your character what weapons you are going to use approach quests and fight enemies they all play role in how your story will unfold these choices can be good bad funny or emotional making you more and more attached to the characters within the worldits shame that the number of bugs in the game can kill or otherwise set bad tone for certain missions hopefully cdpr will sort these out soon allowing people to experience the game as it was meant to be playedhowever the amazing music and the masterfully crafted story make up for downsides and although you will want to experience the other endings that only justifies another playthrough with different style to see just how much your choice matters cyberpunk 2077 set an impressive standard for openworld rpgs that few games in the future will be able to beat it is truly remarkable game worth

so here it is cyberpunk 2077 is out after its announcement that is almost 8 years agobut is it worth it should you buy it i will give you brief summary on what i gathered in my first 11h of game experienceno spoilers will be included in this reviewgraphicsfor those asking im playing with 2070 super oc intel i79700k 45ghz 32gb ddr4 3000mhz on 1440p 144hz monitor without any problems on highest setting with raytracing off and some filters off film grain and motion blur the game runs at most times on perfect 80fps but drops down to 60 in some placeswhile sometimes the graphics feel sometimes bit blurry while driving in open world at day at night it looks fantastic if there is one thing cdpr did great it is the atmosphere of night city which really feels like dystopian future of its genre sometimes i even got blade runner vibes one thing i must say is though on how damn beautiful the faces are of characters that you must interact with or which you are allowd to interact i really loved staring into the face of jackie judy or other characters since they looks sooo realistic and pleasent to look at the wrinkles their facial expressions this is the magnus opum of face graphics and im not joking if just every npc would have it yes the faces of random npcs arent that good and it looks like only the ones you should and could interact with have been deliberately worked on to look that good which is understandable to be honest overall game looks great the city damn great atmosphere and the faces of only the main characters look fantastic turn raytracing off though since its probably to hard on your gpu if you dont have 3070 or highergameplayoh god here we goi really must say the game is buggy i didnt have anything gamebreaking yet but i had many buggs that made tragic scenes funny as hell and other things that were so absurd that it feels like im playing bethesda game cigarettes or cigars are floating in the face of characters or npcs while smoking themnpcs spawning or going through objects which shouldnt happenobjects as glasses and trash explodingcars getting stuck in objects or spawning in themobjects that are switched graphicaly to other objects like you equipped gun but have noodle box in your handi would have listed much more since it should be bug but those things i will mention now arent even bugs to begin with in my opinionpolice spawning right behind you after commiting crimecars dont react to obstacles and dont even evade themnpcs are crouching and many times not even running away when shooting at them or near themsorry but game like gta3 even somehow could do police chase in their cars while in cb 2077 they would not bother and just spawn behind you so you get killed as fast as possible im really pissed about those points mentioned above that are not bugs but just badly programmed npcs i cant even call that aione thing i really dont understand though are customability of your character cdpr promised sooo much out of it on how much you can change and stuff and im not talking about the penis though even i thought you can customize it more you cant change your hair after it since there is barber shop in that game like how come you can buy dildos while there is barber in this game are you guys nuts this is one of the most essential side things you want in an open world game it makes even less sense since there are barbers in witcher 3 so warning to those making their character it is final so choose wisely as you cant change many cosmetic features of you characterthe driving is uhhh horrible with cars and acceptable with bikes but somehow i must say that this is tradition in many games with many studios looking back at gta4 watch dogs and more i can look over itthe fight abilities are good sometimes it doesnt feel good tho play with particular gun sometimes it does i think its really subjective to the player to what and which gun feels great to shoot with and so onstory and sidequesteven though i have almost 11h i didnt come to play some sidequests i will update this review though after finishing this game which will take while the story to this point is interesting and gripping which is one of the reasons i still feel enjoyment in playing this gameconclusionthe game is in my opinion not ready they should have postponed it for atleast another year to fix many of those unnerving bugs adding more options and promised functions and adding an ai for the cars and police chasesoverall the world looks great the graphics are also nice and i still have fun to play itso should you buy it if you like the genre why not should you buy it nowabsoluetly notwhen should i buy it after some months best you check the state of the game after 2 months and think about itcan i recommend itnot in this state it is unfinished game which should have taken more timewhy do you still keep playing it and didnt return itwell i got it as present and i still enjoy its atmosphere and its story till now but that could changeseriously wait till some months have passed and more hotfixes and content is added that was promised from the beginning cdpr made to many ambitious statements while biting itself in the arse making this gamethe hype and the pressure to release the game as fast as possible after finishing the last witcher 3 installement blood and wine made the game to what it is now they should have followed their own statement with coming when its ready and should have withstanded the pressure of releasing it sure open world games are not easy to make and there will be always some funny bugs in it look at gta bethesda games and so on but there is sooo much missing and so many problems that shouldnt be in final product which makes kinda dissapointed coming from the so called best customer friendly developerbut as we know cdpr they surely will fix it but it will cost time so wait some months and check the state of the game then i will update this review after finishing this game which could take some time i will address future hotfixes and additions to the game and also tell you about the story till then see you,No recomendado,0,6086,82,Negativo,"['Gráficos detallados y

after almost 80 hours and completing every side mission in the game i finally finished cyberpunk 2077 so far im not sure how i feel about the ending but i certainly have thoughts about the rest of the game while i wasnt as much into the hype as others i still preordered and got up in the middle of the night to play on launch dayi have never felt so ambivalent about game before its not 310 or 610 or 1010 because i can not possibly merge the things i loved and the things i hated into one score heres my random thoughts on the aspects that i liked and those i really didntthe goodnight city my god what beautiful vast varied place at times the lighting and colours reached level of perfection reminiscent of control sundown in the desert was damn near photorealistic at times and dont get started on the grimy gloomy perfection that is japantown and little chinastarting out i went into most gigs as stealthy hacker and got very frustrated with the unreliable detection system and how difficult it was to tell whether an enemy could be taken out safely with quickhack or not then i tried going in guns blazing instead and suddenly i was playing doom seriously the music the pacing jumping and sliding all over the place it felt pretty much like doom and i loved it played the rest of the game as complete badass with an assault rifle and the occasional quickhackthe narrative is solid disregarding the disappointing tease that is act 1 there is lot to love here as someone who primarily plays games for the story i was hooked fairly soon and found myself caring for many of the characters some of the main missions were absolutely breathtaking heh and i enjoyed all the long conversations great deal as they were very well written the endings are bit of mixed bag though and i can not possibly see how any dlc could pick up where they left offthe music the soundtrack is awesome especially the doomesque combat music but what i absolutely fell in love with was the samurai tracks by refused will be listening to never fade away chippin in and black dog for many months to comejohnny ill eat every last bullet in the city for you if thats what its going to take sniffthe badthe original story line and premise were probably scrapped at some point in development to be replaced by what we have now bits of it can still be found in the life paths and the entire act 1 leaving decidedly bitter taste of what could have been while i like the narrative that we did get i felt that act 1 promised very different game and it should have been several hours longer at the very least developing that friendship with jackie should never have been relegated to an action montage the game tells you briefly why v cares about jackie but it never tells you why you the player should and so it all falls flatcustomisation there is none why do i sink hours upon hours into open world rpgs because i can customise my character to t on my adventures appearance equipment weapons mountsvehicles perks i was so certain there would be barbers and tattoo parlors in this game i didnt even bother looking it up in reality there is nothing visual customisation at all and the stat customisation is utterly boring you can replace your eyeballs but you cant cut your hair there is vehicle customisation whatsoever visible weapon customisation either and i fail to see where 5 limb damage mods is compelling personalisation of your equipment there are many perks but the vast majority of them is as boring and uninspired as the weaponclothing mods there was plenty of misleading marketing but this for was the worst fashion is everything in night city off there isnt even single decent hat in the entire townthere is roleplaying dialogue options are very basic and decisions far and few between v is not going to change based on your actions or at all really romance options are limited to say the least to avoid spoilers ill simply say that after getting together theres nothing more going to happen until the very end oh you can move in with your love interest that is an icon will appear on your map designating their place as one of your apartments safe house but there is absolutely point unless cdpr seriously expects to drive across town to make stupid faces in my boyfriends mirrorthe npcs and ai this been discussed in many places so i wont go into too much detail whenever danger breaks out npcs crouch down into generic position that looks like placeholder sometimes they panic because i sprint the police system is complete joke they dont give when i go on rampage trying to drive my bloody car but for some reason get real touchy when i look at them while passing byafter many years of modding skyrim i thought i was resistant enough to not be annoyed by any bugs i might encounter boy was i wrong the glitches visual and otherwise just happen constantly taking crap on immersion at every turn quests get stuck and require you to reload an earlier save during one long main mission 5 second audio loop from an earlier cutscene got stuck for about ten minutes playing over relevant dialogue since the mission kept going i couldnt savereload to fix it either so it ruined the whole thing at least the game didnt crash on yaythe performance ranges from decent to utterly atrocious i realise that my processor is getting somewhat outdated i5 7600k 42ghz and was certainly bottlenecking my gpu rtx 3080 bought specifically for cyberpunk playing at 1440p with many of the settings turned down and crowd density set to medium my frame rate would still drop below 20 in the downtown area which is bad joke outside the city it sat at comfortable 7080fps but as soon as i got closer to the city centre the game turned into sluggish unresponsive messthe conclusioni enjoyed the game great deal i am also severely disappointed cyberpunk 2077 is rough unpolished experience that clearly needed more time in the oven whats there is for the most part very good but constantly overshadowed by what could have beenoverall i just can not recommend the game in its current state,No recomendado,0,6045,83,Negativo,"['Ambientación visual detallada y variada',

good morning night citynight city 2077 you play as v mercenary that wants to be legend in night city and for this to happen youll need to steal the relic biochip invented by arasaka one of the most influential megacorporations in the whole world now that ive just scratched the surface of the plot i can begin with this review city of dreamscyberpunk 2077 the most beautiful city that ive ever seen in video game and at first sight the most vivid city in game history but only at first sight when walking through night city you can see all npcs going on with their lives working shopping or just walking around but of course like in any game it is just an illusion to make the city feel alive however they failed trying to build up this illusion mainly when there is major interaction with the npcs just oneline dialog that repeats over and over again just like in the witcher 3 but here in cyberpunk hits different another thing that killed that illusion for personally was the crowd ai oh boy that ai is terrible when you look back at gta v and older games even and compare its ai with cyberpunk well there is comparison cyberpunk 2077 ai in general are awful and totally immersion breaker and for sure they were big dreamerscontinuing on with the world itself cdpr managed to handcraft beautiful and immersive openworld full of details that you can get lost in its beauty although there isnt lot to do in it in my point of view night city as i said is the most beautiful but at the same time the most empty city that ive seen in the past years because there is absolutely nothing to do in this huge city besides walking and doing some repetitive activities that pop up around the map yet there are random events like weve seen in red dead redemption 2 for example nor extracurricular activities as we see in many other games hell even in gta san andreas 2004 we could go to the gym barbershops casinos even take taxi so on another one of its downsides is the lack of character customization after the character creation for game where style is everything this is huge problem im pretty sure that cdpr planned lot of those activities but to meet the deadlines theyve had to cut it out of the final game now we just need to wait and see if theyre going to implement some of those things in the gameback in 2019 cdpr stated that cyberpunk would have wanted system and corrupt police well at least we got wanted system but not as you expected the police system is just awful literally there is car chase or proper ai for the police they just spawn behind you whatever the place you are at i remember gta 3 from 2001 having better police ai than cyberpunk and thats ridiculousthis is rpg after allat the end of the day cyberpunk 2077 tries to be an rpg but is it really when they first announced the lifepaths i got really excited and even more when i read that every lifepath choice would affect the world around you and that was big fat lie first of all lifepaths just change the game introduction and some minor dialog options and thats it major changes at all about the general choices yes lot of the choices that you made in the main quests or even side quests can have an impact on your ending or at least some important dialogs throughout the story when it comes to rpgs one of the most important things is the skill tree here in cyberpunk we have huge skill tree and it works quite similar to the skyrim skill tree you can upgrade your character to be melee specialist heavy weapon specialist or combine everything in one and be an overpowered one tap machinethe gameplay itself is pretty average nothing spectacular but not bad either we can carry 3 main weapons and toss variety of grenades there are the implants that we can only buy new ones or change the currently equipped on ripper docs the implants that you acquire on ripper docs can play huge role in your gameplay as you can upgrade your max health and carry weight etcthe hidden gem not so hiddenthe best part of the game so far is the main story and the main side quests if i can put it that way cdpr did great job telling the story in way that you dont feel overwhelmed or tired and gets even better when you get to know the characters and their stories you can connect really easily with the characters and thats huge point for in this huge game industry lately theres been lack of good characters that you feel for and cyberpunk 2077 makes you care about the characters even more than you shouldthe soundtrack is impressive even if many of the songs didnt suit my style they did awesome work creating the soundtrack unfortunately the main quests are too short compared to witcher 3 about 20 hours if you rush throughout the game i finished the main plot in 50 hours however half of my playtime was doing side missions and exploring the map ive had so much fun doing side missions and some ofem are i dare say better than some of the main storyrelated quests the not so good the bad and the uglynonetheless the bugs as everyone might know by now cyberpunk 2077 is full of bugs i can make book with five thousand pages about the bugs in my playthrough i didnt encounter any gamebreaking bug thank god but theres lot of glitches for example cars flying around npcs appearing from nowhere and lot of clipping glitches more than usual etc the most annoying bugs are questrelated ones even though i didnt encounter any gamebreaking bugs there are still some glitches that ruined my immersion and i hope that theyll fix those very soonconclusionim really divided about this game in one hand there are the great main storyside quests and the great characters but on the other hand theres lot of bugs glitches and main issues that make this impressive world well less impressive ill recommend cyberpunk 2077 more because of its great story characters and fun gameplay however we should treat this review as mixed one but steam doesnt allow us to do so im looking forward to seeing if cdpr will pull off hello games and make cyberpunk more enjoyable game,Recomendado,1,6016,84,Mixto,"['Historia principal y misiones secundarias', 'Personajes bien desarrollados', 'Jugabilidad

confused mess with structureim not going to talk about the bugs or performance of this game those are things that can get patched out but there are some clear foundation issues with this game that dont really begin to rear their ugly head until youre good 40 hours into the experience story issuesthe story loses its steam the moment you put it under scrutiny after act 2 starts v as character drive in the game whatsoever to move the story along at her own pace she choice in most of the missions youll be doing whether main or side story quests lot of the characters will simply boss v around to do their bidding and even if she seems outright disgusted with their requests shell always end conversation agreeing to do whatever it is they want her to do the story bite either for the few action sequences that exist in the game none of them are all that exciting the end of act 1 is likely going to be the most exciting moments the game to offer and everything following after is poor mess of vaguely apolitical filler that barely scratches the surface of why corporations are bad in this game you spend 90 of this game blasting homeless people and gangs in night city and it almost feels like you run around as beat cop with the amount of ncpd related gigs and sidemissions you accumulate throughout your playtime this game tries so hard not to send message that you only have nebulous feeling of how awful things are only if you spend your time reading the shards it spends lot of time telling you what to think and barely any time showing you the ramifications of mass corporate exploitation one good example of this is what happened to all of the animals in night city there is reason for it but its buried under so much bloat that one would only assume it was because they didnt have enough time to program dogs into their game overall the story is nothing interesting i didnt come away from it feeling any attachment to the characters as you spend so little time actually getting to know them outside of blasting your way through their problems repeatedly until they feel some vague sense of connection to you for pulling their asses out of the fire so many times rpg elements and the lack of choiceperks weapons and cyberware in this game have such weak effect on how you play this game that they might as well not have given you the option to make choices whatsoever despite there being such broad range of tools to use great many of them feel useless most of the perks are marginal percentage increases over your stats and genuinely never provide enough direction for the player to approach problem beyond just shooting their way through everything with their given choice of weapon some of the stealth options are especially strange because they buff your attack and crit change out of stealth with melee weapons but if youre in stealth behind an enemy you can simple grab them and snap their necks for an instant kill it makes almost little to sense in why you would choose to invest in less reliable form of stealth killing when they give you the best option at the beginning of the game lot of things feel as if they were added as an afterthought to this game weapon elements have bearing on how you play this game whatsoever because enemies have binary health bar that youll burn through with your weapon of choice if you even remotely invested in its respective skill tree enemy variety exacerbates this issue as none of them really counter you if you happen to bring weapon of the wrong type into the fight i dont even begin to know where to unpack lot of my frustration with these systems as they all end up feeling so shallow and worthless in the end it would have been better for the health of the game not to add them whatsoever nonexistent qolwhy is it that i have to hunt and search across all of night city to find shops that carry loot appropriate to my level why can i not change my character after customization stat respec you can respec perks why is earning eddies such chore this is short list of problems that make the game frustrating to play at very basic level and it only gets worse once you start reaching the upper end of max levels in this game heres the really big one quests iconic weaponsarmor and quest rewards do not scale with the player whatsoever you will reach point in the game where everything on the map is very low in challenge for you and there will be reason to do it if youre completionist this feels awful because the challenge of the game is invalidated even if youre playing on the highest difficulty it feels lame to pick up johnnys iconic gun near the end of the story only for it to be worse than revolver i picked up 5 hours ago because the quest rewards dont scale also upgrading doesnt work here the upgrade economy in this game is not well thought out whatsoever and youll end up completing the game before it ever becomes relevant in meaningful way just craft 50 armadillo mods and slot them into every piece of armor you get and youll never have to worry about anything posing challenge to you in this game again final thoughts2077 is rusted and broken down car welded together poorly and slathered in coat of paint more expensive than its shell the longer it runs and the more the paint starts to strip away the more the issues of the game start to rear their ugly head this game its moments sure its not all awful but its not innovative for as beautiful as night city can be it feels like you have little to impact in the world there are so many little things that bother about this game the lack of romance options the poor driving mechanics poor quest rewards and everything listed above it leaves feeling resounding eh for this game it was never going to live up to the hype people had for it but it didnt even deliver solid middling experience in the end shallow lakes worth of content and rather pathetic sendoff for game that had so much potential,No

if youre looking for decent rpg id advise you to search somewhere elsemy pc isnt exactly up to snuff so i wont comment too much on the technical aspects but ill talk bit about the gameplay and world itselfthe world and lore of cyberpunk itself is pretty interesting and the story at least for is also very solid your interactions with this world however are pretty shallow npcs walk through the streets on scripted path like zombies only to eventually despawn and be replaced by another npc cars do the same and will despawn after you move away from them bit neither cars nor npcs have ai so they dont actually respond to what the character does unless scripted to for example if you park your car in the middle of the street cars will just pile up until the obstruction is removed they wont go around it if you so much as bump into police officer they will turn hostile accidentally brush an npc too hard they all flee in terror punch the air npcs will duck and beg you to spare their livesspeaking of the police system it isnt passable for game released in 2020 especially after 8 years of development once you are wanted police will spawn few yards behind you infinitely until you move out of the area alternatively you can duck and hide briefly and theyll go away you can hack someone with sword police come hide for couple minutes and then hear them say oh im sure they wont do it againthe world itself features very little interactivity too npcs only say one or two things if you try to talk to them most of the doors are locked in the world initially i thought that meant i could eventually unlock them but it simply means they are inaccessible if you help police take care of criminal they wont realize the criminal is gone and will still speak as if or she is there this could be bug not sure i once saw man pounding on vending machine because it ate his money i hacked the machine and made it dispense many cans the man continued to beg on the machine not responding to the myriad of cans on the floorcompare this to the kid chasing the rat in fallout new vegas if you kill the rat the kid will thank you and begin eating it small details like this makes the world feel alive unfortunately for cyberpunk everything feels for show and if you look even somewhat closely it all falls apartit falls completely flat as an rpg your decisions will rarely have consequences and the ones that do only have very short term effects dialogue options are poor giving your normally only 1 real option and 12 or 3 side options to get more exposition every couple of hours or so the game may give you speech check but this only yields more information and doesnt have real impact on the story you also can not fail checks and get hostile or comical response the option is just greyed out if you do not meet the requirements you cant flesh our your characters personality its all pretty much premade for youcybernetics one of the core parts of the game have marginal impact on the story the enemies and characters you will encounter will get pretty neat implants but most will not be available to you outside of the ones on your arms cybernetics do not change your character cosmetically and most improvements are superficial for example ive noticed many implants just give additional carrying capacity or increase armor there is also not cutscene for installing said implants though there is 1 cutscene when you get the very first one in story mission and that is it you install cybernetics the same way you buy cup ramen and it seems so anticlimactic given how cool the first scene iscrafting is pretty much pointless and the upgrades are marginal you are better off finding new gun or looting one off an enemy in this regard the game often feels like looter shooter but not very good one searching for items and looting in general both suck the combat itself is decent but enemies become bullet sponges very quickly unless you constantly upgrade your gear on the other hand they will also kill you very quickly if you do not upgrade your armor on the topic of combat the ai is so basic in this regard you can pretty much cheese through any encounter and enemies are only ever real threats if they are seriously overleveled in comparison to you though even in this situation you might still be able to cheese the ai by stunlocking it or hiding behind cover during mini boss encounter i took cover behind crate instead of chasing out the enemy just looked at as i shot it in the head dozens of times not moving once until it had diedside quests in general are pretty uninteresting there were some good ones but overall most of them feel like filler content used to get money and gear for the main quest the main quest tends to give more than enough money and gear anyways so doing side quests doesnt seem all that necessary and when most of them are pretty uninteresting i doubt lot of players including myself will go out of their way to finish them that said there were some real gems but most were go here touch or kill objective get reward there is also radiant quest system akin to skyrim or fallout 4 where quests will generate randomly these include hostage situations assaults you can intervene in shootings stuff along this line for these scaled very poorly to my equipment enemies would take dozens of headshots and lose fraction of their health but would kill in one hit at the same time the main campaign seemed more appropriate in difficult for my progression it was odd and frustrating overall the story is decent and the combat can be fun at times though the ai is pitifully easy to manipulate and not going at using tactics as an rpg the game falls completely flat and feels more like hallway shooter than an open world adventure the setting

as an avid soulsborne player i really tried and gave this game my all i wanted to like it so badly but i cant bring myself to even complete second playthrough this review will contain spoilers so i advise skipping this review unless you have thoroughly completed the gamefirstly id like to start off with the great things this game doesbetter melee variety i love how there are different viable attacks when fighting with melee weapons ashes of war while some are quite busted is great mechanic to shake up monotonous melee combat i love that charged strong attacks and jumping attacks are not only viable but some of the strongest attacks you can do i love how shields can be altered and tweaked to match your build wonderfully and how useful they feel when performing guard breaksworld design aesthetics this game while being soulslike does an amazing job at separating itself from the look of the other souls games the highfantasy themes really show through in this games most beautiful areas even enemies and bosses themselves look amazing this game easily the best visuals aesthetics and design out of all of fromsoftwares current titlesexploration sense of scale level design this game feels massive with so many different things you can do and so many enemies to fight the legacy dungeons are all so fun to explore and make for some of the most classic soulsborne gameplaynow on to the cons i have with the gameboss enemy design truly the most upsetting thing about this game for the simplest way to sum up this issue is that it feels as if your character in elden ring is from dark souls 1 and the enemies are ported from dark souls 3 i really have issues with bosses having neverending combos of attacks granted that i have the equal and opposite ability to properly react and evade the combat in elden ring often feels challenging in the wrong way bosses more often than not have combos that never seem to end and also an apparent fetish for aoe moves i also find the bosses enjoy falling into loop of repeating moves time and time again spamming the same moves until your corpse is butchered to pulp my character ended the game with 60 vitality and it still felt like i never had enough hp armour seems to have little to purpose as i have to invest in endurance and sacrifice one trinket slot to have dollar tree version of havels ring in order to wear armour that feels stronger than paper mache the amount of repeated bosses in this game is really disheartening after exploring catacomb 59 and finding the misbegotten warrior and another trash mob in an arena the sense to explore is fleeting feeling it is tragic and feels horribly lazy and undercooked other fight drives this point home better than the godskin duo if youve been playing the game to the highest extent then youve fought these enemies multiple times caelid tower the witches village volcano manor etc already youve seen these bosses far too many times to count however the creme creme is awaiting you at the crumbling faram azura where you have to fight them for one last hurrah both at the same time this is an essential fight you need to do to beat the game i really implore anyone that avidly enjoys this game what was the purpose of putting this fight there i find myself asking this question far often than i should when i encounter reused boss in an area that didnt need bossit seems that major strategy of elden ring is to avoid engaging with the boss most if not every challenging boss follows this same logic fighting radhan just hit him couple times stage one then spam the summons second stage and never attack him directly fighting melania just stunlock her and use mimic tear to take aggro off you so when she uses her 1000 hit combo the fight just doesnt abruptly end the list goes on with people listing just use bleed bloody slash use magic use x ash of war and spam it until theyre dead use the rotten stray and proc scarlet rot insert exploit here none of these are proper solutions did you feel sense of accomplishment when you bloody slashed the 27th boss to death did you feel satisfied when your mimic tear summon soloed the boss did you have fun watching scarlet rot tick down that boss youve been struggling to beat you shouldnt have to respec to fight certain bosses every fight should have viable solutions and sense that every playstyle chance to win whether that chance be low or high it should always feel possible and it shouldnt feel like the odds are so stacked against you that you have to make do and essentially exploit the game to continue onthis entire game comes to climax inside the erd tree in easily the most disappointing final boss in all of souls i still remember the first time i fought gwyn gherman and the soul of cinder each of these games built up their final fights so immensely well it was challenge i was overjoyed with walking through the fog gate into gwyns boss room is feeling i will never feel again the dread knowing that everything that ive accomplished come to this final moment and when i win i can finally fulfil the prophecy foretold to i felt nothing when i got to the elden beast i felt sense of accomplishment joy fear happiness just nothing it felt like nothing had led up to that point there was buildup emotion struggle sense of accomplishment just gauntlet of two mediocre bosses back to backi really tried to enjoy this game i really did but the boss design in this game really brings it down many pegs for and kills all replayability this game ever could have if you enjoyed this game im happy for you but i just want to voice my feelings for others that may have felt the same way if you didnt like the game thats ok if you did im happy you enjoyed it and could see past the things i took issue withoverall as soulslike this game simply does not do it for and maybe others may share my feelings as well,No recomendado,0,5855,87,Negativo,"['Melee variety', 'World design aesthetics', 'Exploration sense of

im so excited to be pointing the finger at this sport on steam everyone on the console feels really bad and the pc version worked very well for i was amazed at this game and spent more than 150 hours experience city story character building and enjoying branching choices and opportunitiesthe good1 the story and quests the story is beautifully crafted believable and wonderfully cyberpunk be it in the main story or the side quests all of the dialogue is polished and thoroughly enjoyable the game 3 different starts nomad street kid corporat 4 different genderspecific romance options and 2 additional ones each and every one coming with beautifully crafted and believable story and 5 different endings to explore that shouldnt be rushed and explored over multiple playthroughs im going to go out on limb and say do the bill jablonsky quest you will not be disappointed2 the overall city life experience i felt that the city is believable and it was so much fun stumbling upon all kinds of events all over the districts sometimes the janky driving can actually deprive you from finding some real cool art loot character lines etc that the developers have so lovingly and cleverly put in the game while i would agree that there are things missing wasting money in casinos slots etc there are such locations in the game i personally never cared about these activities3 the combat the first person experience is amazing it is difficult enough to keep you occupied but also not too punishing especially as you start learning how to use your chosen builds strengths properly as i have tested it myself from start to finish over these 320 hours every build is viable and works from full on get in their faces to picking enemies from distance with snipers and hacks it is all very enjoyable admittedly some weaponperk combinations work better than others but as this is an rpg it to cater to multiple playstyles and playthroughs and i can tell you it does4 weapons this deserves separate point as there are useless weapons in the game and cater to every possible option player might desire close combat to long distance sniping every weapon can be accommodated in build and specific playstyle get in their face with bats katanas mantis blades or guerilla arms get in close range with shotguns pistols the monowire be true soldier behind cover utilizing submachine guns or assault rifles or just go the sneaky long range sniper route and combine them with silenced weapons to take out enemies from stealth the variety is great and the additional weapon variations power for richochets tech for wall penetration and charging for more damage and smart for brain aiming while negating enemys armor work well towards creating the character that you want5 the music damn if it isnt damn near perfect it thoroughly deserves the double damn in this sentence which became triple damn and in the brackets quadruple damn and with this damn quintuple i listen to some of the tracks almost every day because they are so amazing some are good for pumping up some are chill but they will satisfy fans of almost every genre from techno and pop to throatbursting metal and of course you can choose which radio station to play based on your moodall those 4 points are more than enough to create good open world game to explore and feel sufficiently engaged for many many hoursthe bad1 bugs lets just get this out of the way and be done with it even as of v112 there are multiple issues that at least on pc thankfully dont take that much out of the experience2 missed opportunities the building blocks for multiple random activities are present but not implemented pretty much like in live service game ergo we may or may not see it there is the opportunity for gambling casinos pachinko playing various minigames and various others but they are simply not implemented its clear that the devs thought of adding it but it was pushed back in the development cycle in favor of more important things3 the driving janky at best and you may be stuck in traffic way too often while the devs really tried to add realism by having heavy traffic between 6 and 9 and 16 and 19 sometimes it clogs up the engine and creates way too many roadblocks including cars stuck in one place for reason while you can roleplay and say that that guys car just broke down if you are in quest that requires driving or chasing enemies that is way too irritating most of the time the best vehicle you can use is motorcycle to avoid said problems4 the police system it is clearly rudimentary pushed back in the development process and not properly implemented simply teleporting police officers in your vicinity including in closed rooms nope bad development work on this one just nope5 the 3 different starts nomad street kid and corpo could have had more impact than just 1 measly side quest at certain point of the game i really hoped for more quests based on it and not just random lines in dialogue that sometimes amount to nothing based on dialogue alone corpo is the best starting option as that life path really allows you to deal with multiple problemsconclusioni had and still am having blast with this game over 150 hours in i always want to double or triple my cash investment in game hours and in cyberpunk 2077 i can see myself dumping over 600 hours exploring testing various character builds and even more with the free dlcs that are coming i can only hope the game will get better and better from now on once again i am very sorry for my friends on console but i have pc i bought the game on pc and i need to judge it as i experienced it on pc which started from 710 on patch 106 and is now sitting on very solid 910 since patch 111 i am positive that with the right additions and dlcs cdpr will get this game into 1010 status,Recomendado,1,5789,88,Positivo,"['Historia y misiones', 'Experiencia de vida en la ciudad', 'Combate', 'Variedad de armas', 'Música']","['Bugs', 'Oportunidades

the long awaited game elden ring is collaborative work between the makers of dark souls and george rr martin rest assured that im not some pleb that couldnt beat the first boss and got mad at 88 hours in ive beaten the final boss with the hidden endingfirst off i cant recommend this to people who dont know what theyre getting into if you havent played souls game before this is going to kick your teeth in and the hyped up fanboys will get mad when you ask to see dentist the game is notably difficult but not in clever way that tests your skill throughout the game enemies will frequently have unavoidable instant kill attacks they spam in an area of effect or they randomize the time in their attack patterns so muscle memory plays against you depending on where the spawnpoint is you will likely have significant backtracking to do before getting instant killed on entering the boss room until you get lucky and they change their attack patternsthis feels less like narrative element of the game and more like transparent way of padding their games length and distract you from how otherwise empty the world isthe best part of the game is the design of the creatures sheep roll around birds have swords on their legs and the first major boss is this amalgamated mass of arms and dragons head and overall they nailed it for the visual design of creatures that being said it quickly becomes evident that they copy paste those creatures in different areas with the soldiers and shambling undead being the main offenders for repetition even in areas where that doesnt make senseim unsure what george rr martins influence was exactly for the game whether it was some character names or the whole background lore but none of it is very good writing spoiler alert for every quest every quest i did ends with the npc dying horribly either by your hands or by you stumbling on their corpse when you go to hand in the requested item i have feeling this was george rr martins contribution to the game before the final boss only 2 characters were left alive in the hub area with the subtext that they were on track to burn to death if i finished the game as far as the writing of the game is the game starts off by telling you that in order to be the elden lord you need to stand under the elden ring which was shattered among several demigods except you dont i beat the game with only 4 of the main shards out of seven and i could have done it with less that vast majority of characters are variations of mumbling depressed edgelord or whisper talking wimpas an open world game youll stumble on quests though there werent really any memorable beyond fetch this or deliver this to x the main problem with the quests though is that without any sort of quest log the game will tell you deliver this item to x and then character in question will have moved somewhere else on the map this is especially frustrating as the game gives you tips on how to find or accomplish these quests and opening wiki to check for clarification is required for even the most basic of tasks the most damning of which requires you to hop back and forth between early and late game sections go through unmarked hidden walls and have picked up an item off the ground somewhere else to progress in one area seemingly unrelated to the quest you were on the open world aspect is fine for stumbling on things every now and then but the enemy placement and loss of xp on death means that its also discouraged via having you hopping around save points once you pick play style youre pretty much locked into it with the option to respec your stats coming near the end game and the cost of leveling up becoming more expensive as you play items in the game are not balanced in their distribution ninety percent of the time when you loot something itll be crafting component but almost none of the items are worth crafting weapons and armor all have stat requirements for use but in general there is significantly more strength based weaponry and armor doesnt really matter since most enemies will kill you in two hits meaning its more of preference to how much overkill the enemies deal or how you look as opposed to any sort of any noticeable difference mechanically unless its too heavy at which point you dodge worsethe game coop but its limited to boss areas or the immediate areas in front of them these also require consumable objects and only provide progress to the player requesting help you wouldnt play this with friend unless you had already beaten it and they wanted their hand held not as play together sort of game pvp is present but you can only attack someone if they opt into it and usually they have the coop help option turned on so itll be 3 v 1 in an area of the defenders choosing even if you win the reward is pretty worthless so its unclear why youd do itto be completely honest this game reminds lot of an mmo where one else is online its hard to exactly describe what i mean by this but i think its because of how almost nonexistent the presence npcs the world is for huge chunks the visual design of the world the presence of emotes and message writing and just general grind to level up there are some visually pleasant vistas to look at but the world feels empty aside from the random enemies meandering around the majority of the games lore is done through item descriptions but it feels more like yeah all this happened off screen over there and you just missed it as opposed to being world with things happening around youtldr the game is frustrating the bosses feel unfair the quests make sense and you are left checking the wiki for even the basic idea of what to do and the long play time comes from grinding to beat the game as opposed to actual

bizarre as well as far as i can tell there is option to have brown hair color only amber or black yet vs beard can be set to normal brown meaning that the color pallet exists in the gameas said in my

i really enjoyed this game im fan of froms games so while i was confident theyd make an good game i was worried that the move to an open world format would diminish some of their other strengths i think instead they were able to show new strengths creating an open world that will be new standard by which to compare others going forwardthe gameplay is much like other from games though i did appreciate the effort they made to make it more varied and even in their own way make it more accessible through additional gameplay options between the many new options in this game like spirit summons and the resurrect ability in sekiro you can tell from been looking at ways of giving players alternative methods to overcome the difficulties in their games in smart ways that dont compromise their design and arent bland difficulty slider that changes the game globally pvp seems to have improved featurewise however the times i have played it i found it to suffer from lot of lag its hard to tell if this is caused by players or the game but its extremely common and makes pvp less enjoyable than it could bei found the bosses to be overall easier than in previous games with some notable exceptions where it seemed from was almost making point to show they can still make hard as hell boss fight when neededthe world design makes incredible use of scale and the areas have good amount of variety both in terms of types of environment but also in terms of the enemies within and the content density the first few areas are packed with places to explore and things to find while some of the latter areas are bit more sprawling and sparse i didnt care for some as much as others like the blinding snowfield but with so much thats bound to be the case the enemy variety is worth noting too someone recently counted them up and found that elden ring had more enemy types than breath of the wild ac valhalla ghost of tsushima and horizon forbidden west combinedthe emphasis on open world does mean bit of step down in terms of the small scale level design many of the past games dark souls 1 in particular is renowned for its incredible interlocking vertical layered approach to the world elden ring does have bit of this in spurts in areas the community taken to calling legacy dungeons but not quite to the same extent the graphics are huge step up in quality for from basically look at any screenshot of the landscape and it would probably make an amazing wallpaper from always had good artistic eye for presenting the player with interesting focal scenes and having an open world just allowed them to do that all the more characters designs are largely the same as past games passable but not their strong suit particularly with the faces and as ever the character creator is very difficult to work with perhaps even the hardest boss in the gamethe ui is very much from software ui there are some quality of life improvements like sorting and some better presentation of information but it is what it isthe armor is very cool but for all the variety i kept hoping there would be more maybe its case where theres just never enough but knowing how big of deal fashion is i keep hoping theyll lean into it more the armor alteration system is interesting but it almost feels like it wasnt fully fleshed out as in most cases with some notable exceptions its just about removing the cloak in the future at the least it would be nice to see color palette changes as an additional optionas far as the lore of the world goes this is probably the best realization of froms style of presenting lore in the abstract but discernable through the world and items you find and the lore of this world is very interesting to learn about as you go through the gamequests are bit of mixed bag i enjoyed the content of the quests such as there is im not opposed to froms typical minimalist quest design from tends to not treat quests as traditional rpg quests but more as fleeting ephemeral experiences with characters and things you do in the world may or may not advance your relationship with them much like life i get that however there is also good argument to be made that its still game at the very least if youre going this route with system where the conditions for advancement are not transparent then you need those quests to be reliable flexible and bug free and i feel like in the games current state this is lackingmany times there are quests that behave in unexpected ways or only via exceedingly strict conditions for instance i had one quest that would not advance until i had rested at one specific site of grace other site of grace would do and this one was not obviously associated with the events i had another case where bug preventing character from speaking with that had spending time trying to figure out what i was missing fortunately this was fixed in patch 104i kind of wonder if lot of the nonmainline quest content was added at the very end of development and thats the cause of these issues i get that feeling because even as of the most recent patch new stages to quest chains are still being added which is pretty unusual unfortunately combined with the previous issues this also leads to problems there is one new quest line with new character announced in the patch notes that i am unable to even begin because of nonquest related action that i took before they were added to the game in short im open to the way from designs quests but i think they fell short of what they were going forultimately these complaints dont detract from the overall experience which is still pretty amazing i highly recommend this game and look forward to future dlc,Recomendado,1,5657,93,Positivo,"['Nuevo enfoque en mundo abierto', 'Variedad de

shovelware imitation of game that never actually existed this is not the game which was shown to influencers and later posted on youtube as gameplay reveal that game was purely fake demo created solely for hype this game is an incredibly bad attempt to imitate that game made in short amount of time by small team of inexperienced devs many of the best devs at cdpr already having quit before getting chance to work on any game other than the witcher 3 which was obviously not made by the same people who made this garbagefire of productthis isnt transformers this is transmorphers which is to say loweffort secondrate knockoff rushed out to cash in on hype for something else which in this case was fake demo for game which didnt actually exist most disappointing game in history this is literally the most disappointing game i have ever bought and i wasnt even expecting it to be good as you can see from this group i created before release i thought that this would be mediocre aaa game that wouldnt even measure up to far cry and i was still incredibly disappointedhttpssteamcommunitycomgroupsfarcry2077btw if you bought the game hoping for adult content you are really going to be disappointed in my time in the game the closest i came to love scene was being able to see these fullyclothed middleaged housewives dancing in the window of locked building i couldnt even enterhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2328824055a terrible indie game this doesnt even measure up to the worst of what you would expect in aaa game this is basically terrible indie game that isnt even as good as number of indie games like betrayer and dead effect which i literally purchased for less than 1i actually made list of good indie games most of them dirt cheap and cyberpunk wouldnt make the list even if cdpr were plucky indie dev because it would be an insult to compare anything that is actually good to this loweffort abominationhttpssteamcommunitycomgroupsdecentindiegameswhy is it bad at this point i am going to cut to video which does an exceptionally good job of explaining why you will probably have more fun installing the game than playing ithttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv_cymqhdnykgfeatureyoutubeshort version its not bad because it bugs the bugs are bad because they are distracting people from how bad the game underneath those bugs actually isi have played openworld games since morrowind and gta 3 and this is the most barren lifeless world i have ever encountered cramped spaceship full of zombies like in dead effect feels more interesting than city of drab minimalist buildings that you cant enter and are thus effectively just an ugly map painting while procedurally generated npcs literally pop into view with ai so bad that they actually make the city feel less alive to be frank you shouldnt have traffic in game in which you cant be bothered to give the cars the ability to change lanes or back up you shouldnt put npcs that move into your game if they just walk back and forth aimlessly with terrible animations in way which emphasizes the fact that they are not people or indeed even smart enough to survive as earthwormsyou should not put wanted system in your game if your police ai is literally too stupid to follow the player something that better games managed on the ps2 and you can not work around that by making the police magically appear behind the player and shoot him in the back of the head while at the same time every door and elevator in the city stops working to prevent the player from taking cover insidequests this was obviously not made by the same people who made the witcher 3 many of those people joined to work on this game found that cdpr wasnt actually making it made the witcher 3 instead and then quit in disgust at how badly cdprs game development was being managedthe quests in this game arent good enough for modern mmo much less singleplayer rpg that isnt hyperbole the last quest i did in the elder scrolls online mistress of the lake was more openended allowing the player to choose side leading to one of two very different followup quests more interesting and felt more meaningful than anything i encountered in my more than 12 hours with cdpr 2076in cdpr 2076 the game starts out with dialogue and choices so pointless that i found that not only did my choices not make real difference they literally didnt even affect what people said to in some cases the only good memory i have from this game is being able to pet an ugly cat in an alley and the game took even that away from by making that cat disappear after the boring mission was overhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2326389621 why are you posting review after only 12 hours in the gameif cdpr didnt finish the game why should i i have finished plenty of other games including multiple entries in borderlands final fantasy saints row far cry mass effect all but the most recent expansions in swtor etc i did not finish mass effect andromeda and that game is far better than this onethis game is so bad that i can spend literally hundreds of hours in other games but cant force myself to endure more than 12 hours of this blatant ripoffif you are thinking of buying this game try morrowind with the latest mods it actually looks and sounds better than cdpr 2076 or any one of the other literally hundreds of readily available games that are better than this one this isnt even the best rpg on gog in fact having this game on gog is an insult to most of the other games that are sold theretheres only one good thing to do with this gamehttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2353251355,No recomendado,0,5617,94,Negativo,[],"['Imitación de baja calidad de un juego

4 febrero i was not seated in the glorious hypetrain the cdpr had put on the rails instead i chose to wait until it improved before giving it try to avoid disappointment from bugs and complaints at the beginning of 2023 i started playing the game with low expectations and to my surprise i freakin loved itnever fade awayi think the theme and worldbuilding of the game are its strongest points the game does an excellent job of presenting night city as city full of disasters where even the smallest mistake could end with your dead body in landfill and nobody gives the various affiliations such as the evil corporations that control the world with technology healthcare and even military services the street kids and their gangs like valentinos with their chicano culture the voodoo boys with their technological version of haitian voodoo or 6th street who wants to see nusa great again nomads like aldaceldos who reject the shiny walls scrappers and the dreams that the city to offer instead cling to their family valuesthe game convincingly showcases the consequences of these affiliations in every aspect of the world whether it be economic political or spiritual its clear that the developers did their homework on the cyberpunk universe and brought it to life in remarkable way much like the witcher seriesa like supremei somehow managed to avoid major spoilers for year and i was very pleased with the main story v and johnnys struggle with their identities blend of fight club and matrix is in fine line between multiple personality disorder schizophrenia and depersonalization it is fascinating to see v die and be reborn as new person both literally and figuratively to the realities of night city and work through their issues with johnny who is completely different persona legend of the past the balance between side jobs world events and main jobs arent as smooth as i expected it to be despite playing the game without taking long break i had trouble with connecting with some of the characters or understanding their motivations for certain actions it is most likely designed around the main story and main side jobs which are included in endingsthree specific side jobs stood out to and showed the games potential the sinnerman questline with stephenson former criminal who turns to religion and is exploited by the evil corp for crucifixion instead of death sentence is an incredibly engaging and provided emotional tension throughout the quest the second is rivers questline about an ordinary nypd officer whose nephew is kidnapped by man who brainwashes lost teenagers into becoming cyberpunk versions of what you would call humanbroodstock lastly theres peralezs questline about an honest politician who is unknowingly controlled by corporations due to injected false memories and how they become paranoid and lose everything over time these three side quests share one big commonality theyre grounded in reality and have relatable approach even though the technology and the instruments of the are different overall i like the main story and i feel like they did not use all the potential they had in many aspects of the game the majority of the side jobs feel uninspired but there are hints of what could have been better im hopeful for improvement with the upcoming dlcs and sequelchippin inthe gameplay is intriguing with the possibility to test out different builds and optimize your cyberwave to handle everything the city throws at youfor example you can use sandavista like martinez in the anime and turn into glorious katanawielding solo merc be knifethrowing or pistoleer assassin that prefers quiet stealthy approach like thief as takemura calls it or you can go full netrunner basically cyberpunk variant of mage and perish everyone by just hacking them over their own security cameras unfortunately it gets stale repetitive quickly and you realize that the many builds out there to discover is mere illusion even though it can be enhanced to some point by mods just like the plot i see great potential in the combat and build systems but it is definitely not implemented in complete wayside activities such as nypd announcements and gigs turn into mindless repetitive activities after short time despite my efforts uncover their story through the messages and objectives given by the fixers they just turned into various chores to get 100 completionits been over year since its release but there are still persistent bugs that sometimes require loading previous quick save the bugs didnt ruin my gameplay but it forces the player to take frequent quick saves to prevent any gameplay errorsthe general consensus that the game being unfinished is mostly applies to the gameplay and i agree on that it is enjoyable but definitely not polished enougharchangelin conclusion cyberpunk 2077 is game that the potential to be classic in the gaming world but it falls short due to its incomplete gameplay repetitive side activities lingering bugs and its take on the side stories despite these issues the game is still enjoyable and worth playing especially for those who are fans of openworld games or interested in the futuristic theme yet again i believe that the gameplay in the witcher series was not outstanding either but it was the unique theme setting and compelling stories that turned it into legendary piece i hope to see similar emphasis on storytelling in cyberpunk which would make it even more captivatingthe narrative character development and worldbuilding are highlights of the game and it was fun journey that i spent hours and hours on i definitely recommend it,Recomendado,1,5607,95,Positivo,"['Worldbuilding', 'Narrative', 'Character development']","['Repetitive side activities', 'Lingering bugs', 'Incomplete

cyberpunk 2077cybermeme 2077what can there be said about the disaster of release that was cdprs hotly anticipated follow up to one of the best games of the last generation the witcher 3 wild hunt that hasnt already been said and then regurgitated ad infinium on various sites and message boards the internet over i initially had joke review in the review section for this game which i am replacing with this one because at the time of posting that review cyberpunk 2077 had become one giant meme not place i would have expected one of the most hotly anticipated and most talked about games in generations to land i know cdpr been tolling away hard at work trying to deliver on the game they promised but the reality is that cyberpunk 2077 destroyed lot of trust and goodwill the company had built up over the years with its followers and fellow gamers and i for one will forever look at them with the eyes of sceptic lot of cyberpunk 2077s problems stem from its core cyberpunk 2077 is technically not much of an rpg at all which is disappointing given the table top source material but more of an action fps with light rpg elements many of its interconnected systems either fail to make an impression or simply dont work point in case i couldnt use single replenishable item in my inventory for my entire playthrough which begged the question why was i even bothering collecting all that shtat least on the pc it ran pretty well and while not quite as cutting edge as many believed it would look in the graphics department if taken as whole it could look impressive at times i did find the main story line gripping and most of the side quests were pretty enjoyable to complete when i had convinced myself i was playing an action fps and not an rpg at all i did feel like the end of the game was incredibly rushed as this was where i acutely felt that the team had simply run out of time and couldnt deliver on the ending they had originally planned especially after the boilerplate missions that ratchet up the tension before entering into the final mission the end felt almost anticlimatic because it was over in such jiffy the final boss felt like joke given that we had been built up to fear him and ended up being complete pushoverat the time of play i did initially find all the various graphical glitches quite hilarious but in the end it did start to subtract from my experience i cant speak for the game now october 2021 as it would require replay but hopefully most of those have been sorted out by now whoever decided that crouch and skip scene should be mapped to the same button really didnt play test the game properly because they would have immediately seen how annoying this is when you accidentally press the b button on the controller thinking you are gon na stand up and then end up skipping cut scene the traffic system and ai police npc enemy needed some serious attention hopefully that also been addressed now also cyberpunk 2077 open world didnt quite revolutionise the genre in the same way the witcher 3 wild hunt had done prior that was disappointingif you temper your expectations cyberpunk 2077 can be an awesome thrill and there are genuine moments where you can see the brilliant game waiting to be unearthed lying underneath its mess of systems and visual bugs and glitches the sad thing is with probably another two years development cdpr would have had the classic game everyone and his dog thought they were delivering because the puzzle pieces are all there they just needed to be joined correctly i do believe it could have been that genre defining game that all other games aspire to be like had it been given more time in development so it was sad to see how it got kicked out the door in such poor state most people would have been fine with further delays well at least the adults among us who i like to think outweigh the emotionally stunted death threat script kiddies living in moms basement because we have jobs families other hobbies that also keep us busy we dont have time to tweet sht i get that there are investors and that they want results and they want to see their investment materialise but the 8 million preorders should have been enough of sign that demand was incredibly high for this title sure some might have cancelled their preorders off another possible longer delay but excellent reviews across all platforms would have driven them all back one to ask was this all really worth it as miyamoto put it rushed game is forever bad delayed one is eventually good those should be words you live by in this industry in the end while i thoroughly enjoyed my time with cyberpunk 2077 the fact of the matter is given the hype and the marketing campaign i fully well expected cyberpunk 2077 to come in as my favourite game of 2021 but sadly that not been the case in fact come year end it might not feature in my top 10 games played for 2021 at all i cant help feeling pang of disappointment about this especially given that the witcher 3 wild hunt ended at 1 back in 2015one word or phrase to sum up the experiencefrustratingly disappointing because there is great game in there waiting to emergeperformancebug related incidentsi am sure most of the visual glitches have been sorted now but at one point they were so bad they were subtracting from the experience i never had any quest bug out but lot of the rpg systems put into the game simply didnt work or were half bakedsimilar to gamesthe witcher 3 wild hunt deus ex human revolution watch_dogs legionrating

after hearing all the fuss about skyrim for many years and seeing it rereleased countless times i decided to give this game try and i regret to say that i was absolutely underwhelmed by it ill try to articulate the reasons as clearly as possible spoilers belowif i had to describe the game in single phrase it would be wide as an ocean deep as puddle right from the beginning the game lot going on you have storyline about the civil war in skyrim and another one about dragons coming back to the world plus many more subplots theres gigantic world to explore with an inordinate amount of dungeons and just as many quests and more than dozen skills with their associated skilltree but most of these elements are spread very thinquests the approach they took here is quantity over quality by light year you cant go two meters without getting quest from somebody but the overwhelming majority are glorified and sometimes not even that fetch quests you either have to collect specific item certain number of common items clear dungeon or kill certain enemy then get the reward thats the long and the short of it credit where credit is due some quests are bit more interesting and have more work put into it like the daedric quests but they are very small minority and end up drowned into the endless barrage of inane babys first quest the game keeps throwing at youthe dungeons are different you get them in three flavors cave ancient tomb or castle with couple of dwarventhemed ones which would be fine if there werent over hundred dungeons so seeing the exact same palette gets really old after while although the designers decided to go the extra mile in some cases and throw couple of trees or bushes in the cave maps so theres that i also would like to mention that im willing to believe bethesda was contractually obligated to put puzzles in the game or something like that because the puzzles are the bare minimum thing that could still be legally considered puzzle usually with the solution right above them because god forbid players have to think for couple secondsmain storyline the first sequencetutorial failed completely to make feel invested in the story and the but thou must feeling was the only thing that carried forward from storytelling perspective my character had little to incentive to go to whiterun after escaping the dragon attack to draw comparison with similar games fallout 3 starts with your father disappearing and you having to track him fallout new vegas starts with you being robbed and almost killed the dragonborn such personal stake on moving the plot forward it gradually starts to appear as the story progresses but its insufficient the characterization is anemic as well further contributed by the classic bethesda move we have 300 npcs but 6 voice actors so half the city sounds the same i dont expect an individual voice actor for every minor npc but it was so blatant it bordered on immersionbreakingcivil war storyline this one showed promise at first it was presented as significant element in the story at the beginning but ends up being completely optional barebones thread not much characterization is provided to either side besides the empire is trying to annex skyrim as part of its territory and the stormcloaks want skyrim to stay independent i dont know how it is for the stormcloaks but after joining the empire i completed dungeon and after whiteruns defense it devolved into series of attack this castlekill this group of soldiers until storming windhelm and killing ulfric and that was the end of it other than passing comments from random npcs there wasnt much acknowledgement of the situation and in classic bethesda move general tullius mentions we should root out the stormcloak camps after the last battle but the game forgot to mark the captains of each camp as nonessential and they were unkillable subplots mage college thieves guild etc while these are some more fleshedout questlines they are slowburn but somewhat serviceable at best the companions and the dark brotherhood to the plot being out there mages college or acceptable but then making you grind like crazy in order to complete the last chapter thieves guild along with dawnguard the characters are at least bit more defined and theres some focus on different facets of gameplay or new aspects ie vampire and werewolf formsskills and gameplay there are several skills several combat related along with an interesting crafting system while the combat system plausibly seems to offer several approaches one of the main problems of the crafting system when it comes to leveling up is that there are means to increase the acquisition of raw materials but the experience requirements for each level get progressively steeper making it increasingly grindy and an absolute chore on the last levels and even then theres not incentive on behalf of the game to focus on crafting as you have several shopkeepers whose products scale with level and its pretty easy to get gold incidentally the main bottleneck here is usually the shopkeepers gold supplyall in all the ideas presented are nice but the execution on several key aspects particularly storytelling really hamstrings the enjoyment im willing to give it bit of pass as it may not have aged particularly well but if i hadnt been for achievement hunting id probably rushed the main quest after while and wrapped it up much sooner as it stands i dont think ill ever touch this game again,No recomendado,0,5458,98,Negativo,[],"['Misiones repetitivas y poco interesantes',
